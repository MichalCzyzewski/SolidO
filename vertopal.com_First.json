Years ago, as a young hot shot in the corporate world, \nI learned the secrets of super success from three gentlemen who mentored me at \ncritical times in my life. \n\n\nConstantine \"Costa\" Gratsos had made his fortune as a lifelong associate of \nshipping icon Aristotle Onassis. He took a liking to me, became my first mentor, and \nshowed me how to swim in the deep, dangerous waters of business. \n\n\nJim Newman, the business visionary who created the term \"comfort zone\" \nshowed me how to expand my horizons. Thanks to Jim, after I attended one of his \nPACE Seminars in 1978, I moved out of my comfort zone at Bear Stearns and became \na super successful oilman. \n\n\nJerry Ormand was already a legendary Texas oilman when I met him. Yet \nhe took the time to introduce me to the fine points of the oil business, and how to \nsurvive and prosper amid the chaos of a rough-and-tumble industry. \n\n\n/ Jerry...

Men of wealth and presumed integrity in the financial world have committe \ntreachery on a scale of uncounted billions of dollars, affecting millions of \u201cordinary people\u201d around th \nglobe. \n\n\nBernie Madoff is the most despicable of these \u201cpirates in pinstripe,\u201d committing fraud of som \n$50 billion, deceiving even his closest associates and oldest friends. By March 2009, Bernie was in custod \nwhile lawyers bickered over the bones of his frozen assets, and he awaited his turn to plead guilty in cour \n\u201cSo what?\u201d say his victims. \u201cOur life savings have vanished.\u201d \n\n\nWe cannot change the past, only recover from it. And perhaps learn its cruel lessons. The first lesso \nis this: the paralysis of fear can cost dearly": null, " while the rewards of determined courage are incalculable. \n\n\nIn the meantime, concealed amid the carnage of financial ruin, are some stocks that dare to offe \nthe prospect of profit. B2C, our own investing group, for example, is engaged more in \u201ccontravesting\u201d tha \ninvesting \u2014 looking for stocks anywhere in the world that are undervalued, mostly paying dividends. We thin \nthis period of bear market is an excellent opportunity to reach boldly for the bargains that are out there. \n\n\nOur advice, as you seek to venture into the heady whitewaters of business acquisition, drean \nteam building and Quantum Leap expansion, is to take courage. Grasp chaos. Force change. And follow th \nmethodologies you\u2019re about to read. One day, sooner than you could have imagined, the financial nightmar \nof the first decade of this millennium will be a harsh but fading memory. \n\n\nAnd you'll have survived to be the super success you knew you could be. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| \u0430\u0433 \n\n\nFOREWORD \n\n\nBy Dr Klaus Kleinfeld \nFormer CEO of Siemens, AG. \n\n\nCongratulations! You have chosen an extraordinary book that describes a step-by-step framework \nand methodology for building a super successful business from scratch, while attaining the skill sets of a high \nperformance person. The precepts described in this book are straight forward, yet very powerful. The author, \nDaniel S. Pe\u00f1a, has put into simple words how he achieved success at the highest level starting with nothing \nmore than a dream and the passion to succeed. I strongly recommend \u201cYour First Hundred Million\u201d for those \nwho have a dream, little or no capital, and desire a road map to build a significant net worth and achieve the \nlife of a high performance person. \n\n\nIt is written in a style that will ingratiate you to the author, because he tells it exactly like it is, \nwith no varnish or hesitation. At times you may even be shocked by how he describes what it takes to be \na high performance person and achieve your dreams in today\u2019s rough and tumble ever changing business \nenvironment. He calls his precepts and methodology QLA, or Quantum Leap Advantage and it\u2019s based on \nhis almost 40-year personal worldwide track record of success. \n\n\nOver many years Dan has become a very good friend. I know Dan\u2019s comments might often raise \nyour eyebrow with his candor. However you will truly enjoy hearing what it takes to succeed from someone \nwho has really lived it. And you can tell this isn\u2019t theory, because he gives you real examples from his life \nand those that he has coached and mentored. Dan has operated in the same real world you do every day \nand succeeded against all odds. But more importantly, countless devotees have used QLA successfully and \nachieved their dreams and goals! \n\n\nRead this book and I know it can be the first step towards the realization of your dreams and being \na successful high performance person. \n\n\nAll the very best, \nKlaus Kleinfeld \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction \nYour Quantum Leap Advantage \n\n\n*Always try to go into business with an unfair advantage. \" \n\n\nYou will never have read a business book like this one. \n\n\nBecause you hold this special edition, you may have heard me speak. You may have even been ti \nmy castle": null, " you might even be a business partner. So you'll realize immediately this book is written the wa: \nI talk to audiences at my \u201cQuantum Leap Advantage\" seminars. You'll also understand it's not a book fo \neverybody, because success (and the wealth it brings) isn't for everybody. But I know you'll profit from it \nbecause it captures under one cover - all the Quantum Leap strategies I've been pounding into people's head \nfor several years now. \n\n\nThe Business sections of bookstores and libraries across America, the UK and Europe are packet \nwith books that tell you how to become a successful entrepreneur. Some of them are written by men and womei \nwho have achieved a respectable level of success. Others are written by professors who understand busines \nas a theory, but have never had their own business. These books typically take the reader through the step-by \nstep mechanics of starting, growing and ultimately selling a business. Others are manuals that cover taking : \ncompany public, tax issues, raising capital and other topics an entry-level entrepreneur needs to know. The: \ninclude checklists, graphs and formats for business plans and letters of intent. There are probably nuggets o \n\u201chow-to\u201d information in these books. But I've found most of them to be as flat and lifeless as road-kill. \n\n\nBut more to the point, none of these books tells you how to prepare your mind for being supe \nsuccessful. They skip over how to adjust your perspective just slightly, so you can take what I call a Quantum \nLeap...make millions of dollars...and do it over and over again! \n\n\nWhat if you had access to the secrets of a man who has the strength, skills and self-confidence t \nmake one Quantum Leap after another, even make them simultaneously, and knows he will ultimately becomt \na billionaire before he quits? What if you could receive, in his own words, the wisdom of this active multi \nmillionaire - not one of those \u201creal estate rich\u201d morons or some silk-suited seminar mooches - but a man wh \ntook his own energy corporation from an $820 investment to an incredible $400 million in market capitalizatior \nin just eight short years! \n\n\nThat's what this book is all about. \n\n\n\n\n\nH \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlg \nIt\u2019s about achieving the mental toughness and laser-beam focus you need to make a ton of money. | \n\n\nI\u2019ve packed this book from beginning to end with the same strategies I\u2019ve been thundering across the financial \ncapitals of five continents, But I've left most of the detailed checklists to that pedantic crowd of pedestrian \nbusiness people and dusty professors who write those *how to\" books. \n\n\nPutting it another way, most business writers give you some weapons, or at least a weapon's \nmanual, and send you out to face the realities of business. Through my Quantum Leap methodology, I show \nyou how to prepare and focus your mind and spirit for executive battle - against entrenched institutions ... \nvicious corporate assassins... and those nay-savers of success, the purveyors of conventional wisdom. Don't \nlet anyone tell you, \u2018You can \u0457 do that!\u2019 Because you can! That's the Quantum Leap difference. \n\n\nThey used to call me crazy...and worse. They'd say, \u2018Dan, you can t do that!\u2019 And, by God, I'd do it. \nThen, when I made my first few million dollars, they started calling me \u201ccontroversial.\u201d A London newspaper \nlabeled me \u201cthe most controversial man in London in the Eighties.\u201d (A public figure is \u201ccontroversial\u201d when \nhe\u2019s got too much money and influence to be called crazy. Besides, he might be crazy enough to sue you into \noblivion.) My British advisors would shiver and say, \u2018Dan, you can t do that!\" So I'd do it. Now, in my \nearly fifties, I'm mellowing into \u201ceccentric.\u201d \n\n\nI thought I would stay retired - I sure as hell don\u2019t have to work - but then I realized what poor \nadvice most people are being fed about success by \u201cfeel good\u201d frauds in the personal development field. \nYou've seen them grinning and charming on TV. You know who I'm talking about. \n\n\nI have become a business success coach to a selected group of entrepreneurs who I feel have \nseemingly boundless energy and determination to become super successful, I also conduct seminars in the \nU.S., the United Kingdom and the E.U. - and at my 15\" Century home, Guthrie Castle, near the North Sea \nabove Edinburgh, Scotland. \n\n\nThrough my U.K. enterprise, the Quantum Leap Organisation, my associates and | identify \nentrepreneurs, and nurture them along in pursuit of their dream. The success stories coming to fruition in | \n| Scotland and England are proving what I've said all along - that Quantum Leap strategies are universal in \n| their application. You can sell a solicitor, a proper \u201cCity gent\u201d in London, on your dream as easily as you can \na lawyer in the United States, and you can take \u00a3500,000 from the Bank of Scotland as smoothly as you can \nfrom a Second Vice President of Citi Corp. \n\n\n\n\n\nI call my basic seminar \u201cThe Quantum Leap Advantage,\u201d and I deliver others as well on more \nspecific entrepreneurial topics. They are all hard-hitting, no-nonsense seminars, packed with the brutal truth \nabout making big money and are delivered \u201cin you face.\u201d One attendee wrote on his critique sheet, \u201cDan \nL Pe\u00f1a is a bulldozer of knowledge...\u201d - I like that! \" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_ \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nABA UU uCLUTE \n\n\n\n\n\n20 \n\n\nI get continuously, \u201cDan, you've said so much in three days. Do you have something I \u0441\u0430\u043f take home anc \nread?\" 1 do have such a book, written in the late Nineties. The QLA strategies and methodologies \u2014 how tc \nmake your first 100 million \u2014 are as relevant today as they were then. Like any good recipe, the QLA recipe \nfor high-performance and super success never goes out-of-date. \n\n\nThis book, in content and tone, is an extension of those seminars. It is my answer to the questior \n\n\nBut since our first publication, so much has happened in the world, the global economy and thc \nbusiness community. So I decided to update the book in time for the second decade of this century and for \u0493 \nnew generation of passionate, fired up entrepreneurial achievers. Maybe like you. \n\n\nBear in mind that I didn't write this book to make you feel good inside or to stroke your self: \nesteem. Instead, I give you the unvarnished truth you deserve about how corporate business really works \nand how you need to think, feel, train and be prepared to make the system work for you, so you can take yow \nfirst Quantum Leap. \n\n\nAnd begin building your own dream. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(u) \n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\ngl \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter One \n\n\nSuper-Success - Not for the Touchy-Feely \n\n\n\u2018Super success is not for the wishy washy. Victory in business, \nlike war, comes to the toughest son-of-a-bitch in the valley.\u2019 \n\n\nThis is a book about making money. \n\n\nI don\u2019t mean a few extra bucks in your spare time, Any moron can do that. I don\u2019t mean increasing \nyour sales 20%, or buying real estate or getting into the discount mortgage scam. I\u2019m talking about making \nso much money you can't count it - you've got to weigh it. \n\n\nThis is no \u201cget rich quick\" book either. \u201cGet rich quick\" implies \u201cget rich easy,\u201d and if you think \nyou can get rich easy in today's world, you're either about to murder your rich uncle - or you're stupid. \n\n\nNor is it one of those \u201cwealth without risk\u201d books. Accumulating money without taking risks is \na fantasy fed to the faint-hearted or the elderly who are not so much interested in achieving wealth as they \nare terrified of becoming poor. The high performers - the super successful - do take risks. I sure did. Still \ndo. Anybody who's not taking risks in business is not making real money. There is no super success without \nrisk. There just isn't. And no safety in being a high-performance person. If you want safety, this book isn't \nfor you. \n\n\nFinally, this is not a book to help you feel better about yourself. \n\n\nConventional wisdom is that if you feel good about yourself, you'll make money. As you'll see \n- if you read on - I grew a company to over 400 million dollars in real market value, working on the premise \nthat all conventional wisdom is crap. The truth is that when you make a lot of money, then you'll feel good \nabout yourself. \n\n\nSo why should you read on? Here are some reasons. I've built from scratch more dollar value \nthan any other personal development or business success coach who'll ever try to sell you a book. I've lost \nmore money in just one bad deal than a lot of those slick-suited guys on the \u201cfeel-good-get-rich\u201d lecture \ncircuit ever made in their whole lives. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat else? \n\n\n[B \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) \n\n\n\n\n\n1e \nst \nre \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nCnapter 1 *3uper Success - INO Jor the 10\u0438\u0441\u043f\u0443 - reen \n\n\n\n\n\ngl \n\n\n70,000 more than anyone who\u2019ll read this book - or anyone selling success books and tapes.

That's probabl: \n\n\nthan 600 financial presentations on five continents (all but Antarctica - there's no money there!), raising ove \none billion dollars during times nobody else could raise a cent! And in between I\u2019ve logged million of mile: \nin travel, thousands of nights in hotels, thousands of business meetings, and more than 250,000 busines: \nphone conversations. \n\n\nIf anybody wants to talk about more business experience in the past 37 years than Dan Pe\u00f1a - i1 \nthe trenches or in the peaks - let me know. \n\n\nYou should also read on because, if you can handle it, this book is written for you. \n\n\nI'm writing to aspiring entrepreneurs who have the fire in their belly to achieve super success. I'n \ntalking to the owners of small or mid-sized businesses, people who are already successful and want more.. \nand the CEOs, Directors and other top executives of companies who are now looking for geometric growtl \nin a competitive, unforgiving marketplace. In short, this book is for \"serious players.\" \n\n\nBut beyond that circle of capitalists, anyone who seeks a greater degree of success in their life car \nbenefit from this book. To borrow from Joe Batten, the advertising legend and mentor to Ross Perot, whos \naccounts included \u045b\u0435 U.S. Army: I'm writing for you if you want to \u201cbe all you can be.\" Now that you\u2019vi \nbought me - I assume you haven't browsed this far - let me assure you I\u2019ve got more for you between thest \ncovers than you'll find in an entire library of sudsy proverbs and platitudes. Hence, the cover price. \n\n\nWhen I retired the second time, a few years ago, I quickly got bored with doing nothing. I gradually \nbecame interested in sharing the brutal truths I had learned in the business world with others. After all, I hac \nmade tens of millions before I was 40 years old. Why not pass along the benefit of years of experience t \nthose who were on the cusp of success, so that they could enjoy extraordinary business achievement of thei \nown. And, quite frankly, my ego demanded it. \n\n\nThat idea led me to make a commitment to be a business success coach. I reasoned that if othe \nsuper successful business performers could deliver their proven wisdom and strategies to a willing anc \n\n\nreceptive audience of eager listeners ready to take bold action, so could I. \n\n\nIcouldn't have been more wrong! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUJ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SEMINAR CROWD - PERPETUATORS OF THE BIG LIE \n\n\nThe Nazis taught us how effective a Big Lie could be. They shouted their propaganda so loudly \nand so often that we in the \u201ccivilized world\u201d accepted their crimes until the brutal truth slapped us in the face. \nToday pimple-faced neo-Fascists scream there was no Holocaust - and a lot of well-meaning people give \n\n\nthem an audience. \n\n\nAt the same time, a much smoother type, the \u201csuccess evangelists,\u201d are infiltrating the country, \nfilling conference rooms and convention centers, and feeding desperate audiences the Big Lie about personal \n\n\nsuccess. \n\n\nMy introduction to the \u201cseminar circuit subculture\u201d was a real eye-opener. It didn\u2019t take more \nthan five minutes for me to realize what the seminar business is all about. The sad truth is nearly all seminars \nlook alike, Most of them are the same distillation of conventional wisdom, spoon fed to you in outline form \nso you can copy it down. And if you\u2019re too slow or lazy to take notes, you can always buy the $495 to $2995 \ntape-set, manual and even software packages conveniently set out on the table at the back of the room. They \ntake all major credit cards... \n\n\nEven more to the point, if you listen to the tapes . . .if you actually read the book, you get the \noverwhelming feeling of, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. I guess I already knew that, I just never saw it organized so \nneatly before.\u201d \n\n\nOf course, doofus!

Personal acceptance by the masses is just not on their agenda.) I\u2019m in this business to give you the \nopportunity to learn how to be enormously successful. Even though half-truths and misinformation are easier \nto sell, I'm going to give you the no bullshit, unvarnished truth. \n\n\nWhen I first started lecturing, I talked to my audiences like I would talk to my staff, expletives and \nall.

Some of these people are really interested in what you've got to say, but you're offending \nthem with your language.\u2019 So I toned myself down to become a kinder, gentler Dan. \n\n\nPaying the Price for Super Success \n\n\nNow that I\u2019ve given you an idea of where I\u2019m coming from, let\u2019s talk about some of the basics of \nbecoming super successful. To begin with, it\u2019s not easy. Every worthwhile goal in life has what I call a \u201cPay \nPrice to Action.\u201d To achieve that goal you must take action that requires you to pay a price in some other \narea. It\u2019s a trade-off. The mooches in the seminar circuit tell you, \u201cYou can have it all. You can be a well- \nrounded parent, make a bundle of money and be loved by all.\u201d That\u2019s crap. The truth is, you have to give up \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10) \n\n\n\n\n\ntier \n\n\ngot \ning \n\n\nof \n\"ay \n\u043b\u0435\u0433 \nall- \n\n\n\n\n\nwww. biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nApe a umpu et \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430 Jur re aviy seer \n\n\n\n\n\nsomething to get something. Throughout this book, you've got to ask yourself - what are you willing to giv \nup, or to trade-off, to get what you want? \n\n\nIf you want to become an Olympic javelin-throwing champion, for example, your Pay Price t \nAction is giving up evenings and Saturdays with the boys (or girls) and throwing the javelin a zillion time: \nYou may have to give up beer and go on a special energy-building diet. You may even have to give up you \njob and get a new one that enables you to throw the javelin more. But you pay that price. You want to gt \nto the Olympics. And you don \u0457 want to bring home a Bronze or Silver Medal. You want a Gold Medal an \nyou're willing to pay the price. \n\n\nAt the Beijing Olympics in 2008, one superstar emerged at Beijing's National Aquatics Centc \n\u2014 the famous \u201cWater Cube\" - a young man who exemplified paying the price. During years of preparatior \nAmerican swimmer Michael Phelps sacrificed the carefree life of other guys his age so that he could becom \na Gold Medal athlete His motto was, \u201cEat, sleep and swim.\" As part of his monastic regimen, he avoide \nfans, friends and even family members who might divert his time and attention from achieving his goal. | \nwas a price he was willing to pay to be the best. \n\n\nIt\u2019s not generally known, but Phelps was meeting and overcoming challenges long before he\u2019 \neven heard of the Olympics. When he was a child, a few \"experts\" doubted whether he would be abl \nto accomplish anything. Even in pre-school, teachers complained that he couldn't stay quiet, sit still, o \nconcentrate. \u201cYour son will never be able to focus on anything,\" one teacher told his parents. He was late \ndiagnosed with ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. \n\n\nSomewhere along the way, young Michael learned to focus. His typical 18-hour day prior t \ncompetition at Beijing 2008 began at 5:00 every morning. Every hour, in fact every minute was schedule: \nto reduce out-of-pool time. During the Olympics, to maximize TV viewer ship in the U.S., the preliminar: \ncompetitions were held at night and the finals were held the next morning, a grueling day even for champions \n\n\nPhelps dismissed talk of making schedules less strenuous. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get up to swim in the morning, don\" \ngo.\" \n\n\nThat level of commitment leads to the next lesson: Super success, whether it's in the Olympics o \nin the boardroom, is not for everybody. When I was building my fortune, one price I paid was not seeing m) \nfamily and not being home for 242 days during the first year of my daughter's life. And I was rarely home tc \ncelebrate the birthdays of my three kids. \n\n\nYou may remember how Michael Phelps' commitment paid-off. He won eight Gold Medals ir \nBeijing, eclipsing the record set by American swimming legend Mark Spitz at the Munich Olympiad in 1972 \n\u044b wonder if Michael's childhood teachers and the other \"experts\" were watching. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> \u041c\u0415 : \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\nal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat costly Pay Price to Action may not be for you. It isn't for most people. That's why there amd \nso few: Ted Turner's and Ross Perot's and, yes, Mary Kay Ashe's in this world. But - and this is important \n- that\u2019s all right. \n\n\nMark Zuckerberg followed the classic American success formula set by Bill Gates and other \n\u201ctechnowhiz\u201d kids. Mark paid the price, spending more of his young years tinkering over a computer than \nhe did being a typical teenager. The pay off? He redefined \u201csocial networking\" for the 21* Century and \nfounded the enormously popular Facebook. That phenomenon now claims more than 70 million active users \nworldwide and gives Zuckerberg, a 23-year-old very eligible bachelor, a net worth of $1.5 billion. Yet I \ndoubt whether he would recommend his path to super success for everyone. \n\n\nIf you put into action just some of the strategies I give you in this book, you'll be a whole lot more \nsuccessful than you are today. And, by the way, you'll save a lot of money by not buying more tapes and \nbooks at future seminars. \n\n\nA lot of people I talk to assume you have to be incredibly intelligent in order to be highly successful. \nI'm living proof you don't. But let's suppose for a second you have an IQ of, say, 100. That's average. In \nthis example, I might be taking some away from you": null, " on the other hand, I might be giving you a little. (Those \nwho've spent a lot of time seeking Universal Truth through seminars, books and tapes, and those who ask me \nobtuse questions during seminars probably have what I call a \u201croom temperature IQ\" . . . a comfortable 72.) \n\n\nLet's also pretend I've got a 100 IQ as well (although my old pals from school days would argue \nthe point). Can anyone have fen times our IQ? As far as I know, the highest IQ's ever recorded were in the \n240 range (160 will qualify for membership of an elite High-IQ group called MENSA). So it's not possible \nfor anyone to have ten times our IQ - or even five times for that matter. \n\n\nSo how in hell do people make ten times more than you make? How do people make a hundred \nor a thousand times what you make if they can't have a hundred or a thousand times our IQ? How? I'll tell \nyou how! Because they dream bigger than you. Their expectations are higher than yours. That's how. \n\nOne of my colleagues in recent years has been Peter Sage, an energetic and highly successful \nBritish entrepreneur, adventurer and international bon vivant. Peter says that when he has an inspiration for \na new venture, if he has any idea of how to bring it to reality, he's thinking too small. Now that\u2019s my kind \nof thinking! \n\n\nI'm often asked, if I had my life to live over again what would I change. I'd only change one \nthing. I'd set my goals higher. That's right. With all my mega-success, I'd still set my goals higher. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about you? \nH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\\\u0447\u0449\u0440\u0448\u0442\u0433 1 *2uper 2uccess - INUL JUT Ult 10\u0438\u0441\u043f\u0443 - \u0433\u0435\u0443 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5i Have you set goals that allow you to \u201cbe all you can be?\" If not, reading this book will be an \nastonishing revelation.

I want you to understand right now \nthat doing the same things over and over, like you've always done them, and expecting different results, is \n\n\ninsanity. \n\n\nYou see, these high-performance individuals, like myself, achieve super success because they \nwant it more than you. They forge favorable circumstances by using the two advantages of high performance \nbusiness people - practiced skills and force of good habits. Or as Jim Ryun, the former world record holder \nin the mile said, \"Motivation gets you started": null, " habit keeps you going.\" Trust me on this. Intelligence has \nnothing to do with it. \n\n\nTake some risks. \n\n\nThe super successful \n\n\nThe super successful also have a different perspective on understand \u041a\u0430\u0442 \u0415\u0435 \n\n\nrisk. Several years ago, a guy named Charles Givens made \u0430 ton of \nmoney on a book he called Wealth Without Risk. He put together a \n\n\nnecessary to grow. \n\n\n\n\n\nwhole program based on money-making/money-saving ideas, hired \n\nsome used car salesmen, and peddled his program in hotel conference rooms all over the country. A close \nexamination of his book revealed that virtually all his *ideas\" were little ideas to make a little money here, \nsave a little money there \u2014 stuff any financial advisor could tell you. \n\n\nThe only people who grew anywhere near \"super successful\" were Givens and his inner circle \nof associates. His converts saved a few bucks on insurance premiums, made a little money in real estate \n\u2014 mostly \u201cflipping houses\" - and thought they were rich. But without taking risks, they were all small \npotatoes, and eventually the Givens organization was dragged into court and has long since disappeared. \n(Givens' legacy is the half-hour \"Paid Advertising\" TV program \u2014 the infomercial - and a generation of \nskilled and dapper pitchmen who still work the seminar circuit trying with only limited success to replicate \nthe Givens phenomenon.) \n\n\nThe genuinely super successful understand that risk is necessary to grow. In my seminars I refer \nto the \"Quantum Leap,\" an explosive, geometric growth in your company that merely more sales or new \nlocations could never achieve. A Quantum Leap requires risk. \n\n\nOne of my favorite \"disciples\" was a young guy named Fidel Vargas, one of a group in the mid- \nNineties I called the *Mexican morons.\" Iquickly saw Fidel's potential and paid for him to attend the seminar \n\n\n\n\n\nat my own Guthrie Castle in Scotland. Much like myself, Fidel was a product of the Los Angeles barrio \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 \n\n\n(13) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\naL except that this Latino firebrand completed his undergraduate work and MBA at Harvard. He also made? \nnational news several years ago by becoming the youngest mayor in the United States at age 23 \u2014 of Baldwin \nPark, California. These days, he runs a venture cap fund for an investment firm in Southern California. QLA \nmade some lasting impressions on Fidel. \n\n\n\u201cDan Pe\u00f1a struck me immediately as larger-than-life,\u201d Fidel said recently, \u201csomebody determined \nto squeeze every last drop of juice out of life. The lessons of QLA are simple but powerful. You've got \nto take risks to be really successful. You've got to be willing to throw your hat over the wall and commit \nyourself to your dream. Dan also taught me that most obstacles to success are created in an imagination \ndriven by fear of defeat, and by listening to the platitudes of conventiona! wisdom.\u201d \n\n\nIf you\u2019re already in business, you understand risk. Remember when you first got started? Didn\u2019t \nestablishing that business require risk? Doesn't marriage require an element of risk? Or raising kids, or \nbuying a new home? Then why do so many people who take risks in other areas of their lives shudder at \ntaking risks in growing their business? No matter how tight your strategy and how sure of success you are \non a given deal, the specter of risk lurks at your side until signatures are on paper and the money is in your \nbank. And preferably spent! \n\n\nI believe that if you\u2019re not taking risks to grow your business, it begins to wither. I hate someone \nto tell me everything is running smoothly. By definition, I know their business is not growing anymore - and \nprobably dying. They have forgotten that from chaos comes order. \n\n\nSome people take a risk or two, and fail, and retreat beneath their shell of safety. Failure destroys \ntheir self-confidence, sometimes for the rest of their life. \n\n\nIn 1955, at the height of the Cold War, everybody had atomic bombs on their minds. School kids \nwere drilled to hide under their desks so a 50 megaton bomb detonated downtown would miss them. My \nfather, the L.A. policeman, was lured into investing $10,000 in the Luck 13 Mining Company, an outfit with \nuranium mines in Nevada. It was a con job, a scam, and he lost his ten grand, which in 1955 was a small \nfortune, But maybe more damaging to him than the financial loss: he was disgraced in front of his family and \nfriends and laughed at for years afterwards. \n\n\nIn 1958, Dad had a chance to buy an undeveloped piece of land northwest of Los Angeles for \n$3000 - the intersection of Topanga Canyon and Ventura Blvds. All four corners! He turned it down. No use \nbeing made a fool of twice, he must have figured. The next time that property was sold it went for $640,000. \nThen 3.5 million, then 8 million. The last time we looked, one corner sold for $12 million! For the rest of his \n\n\ndays, Dad didn\u2019t like to drive up in Northwest L.A. around Woodland Hills. One failure drained his resolve \nto ever take another risk. \nH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever fear failure \u2014 Understand it. \n\n\nThe super successful also have a different take on failure. They understand that failure is what \nhappens when you do something. The greatest successes in the world also experienced the greatest failures. \nThe all-time strikeout record in major league baseball is held by... Babe Ruth. But we don\u2019t remember him for \nhis strikeouts. We remember him for setting a home run record that stood for decades, long before performance \nenhancing drugs destroyed America\u2019s love affair with baseball. No one cares about the Babe\u2019s strikeouts. The \npoint is he kept swinging the damn bat! Most of us never get out of the dugout - let alone up to the plate. Those \npeople not only wonder why they never hit a home run - they even begrudge the determined hitters who do. \n\n\nDonald Trump has lost billions in his financial deals. But who cares? He has made billions more with \nhis successful ventures, and he just keeps swinging the bat. After stumbling into the New World, Christopher \nColumbus failed in his subsequent explorations and died a poor and disappointed man. But on Columbus Day \ndo we celebrate his dying destitute? Of course not. We celebrate his success. \n\n\nThis reminds me of a story about Tom Watson, Sr., founder of IBM, being asked by a young \nmanagement trainee, \u201cSir, how do I get to the top of the management ladder here?\u201d Watson immediately \nreplied, \"Double your failure rate, son. Double your failure rate.\" His point was, of course, that more failures \ncould only result from more tries, more initiative, more risk taking . . . all the actions required for growth. \n\n\nMost of Thomas Edison's experiments failed miserably - thousands of them. He thought direct \nelectrical current (DC) was the answer to lighting the world, and that alternating current (AC) was a passing fad. \nHe was wrong. And nobody cares. Instead, we're indebted to Edison's genius and his determination whenever \nwe turn on a light bulb, or hear recorded music, or watch a movie. \n\n\nFor the super successful, failure is a valuable lesson. It's a road not to take again, or at least under \nthe same conditions. And then they move on. Failure is nothing more than testing. As Edison said, \u201cSuccess is \n99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.\u201d To the high performance person, \u201cFear\u201d is False Expectations Appearing \nReal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a high performance \nperson, you have the \nconfidence in your judgment \nto stand by whatever decision \nyou make. \n\n\nThe sure-fire formula for failure? Try to please \neverybody. That\u2019s the biggest reason most people never achieve \nSuccess. They try to keep everybody happy. As a result, they \nfail and the people they were trying to please don\u2019t give a damn. \nInstead of listening to everyone around them, they should have \nconsulted within themselves. They should have trusted their \ninstincts. They should have listened to their intuition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Listen to your intuition \u2014 It's almost always right. \n\n\nIntuition plays a strong role in the decision-making process of a high performer. Over the years, \nwomen have tried to monopolize intuition. \u201cWomen\u2019s intuition\u201d is a given, but what about \u201cmen\u2019s intuition.\u201d \nI think intuition is what we call instinct in animals, a primal survival skill. All of us have a sense, a gut feeling \n\n\nabout situations affecting our best interests. Usually we run into problems when we ignore our intuition. \n\n\nNowadays the tyranny of computers has undermined our reliance on intuition. Too often we \n\u201cExcel\u201d things to death. Suppose you\u2019re a guy at a party and you meet an attractive woman. Her smile seems, \nwell, more than friendly. She touches you a lot, innocently. You know she\u2019s hot. You don\u2019t need to run back \nto your office and \u201cExcel\u201d it. You don't have to think about it. You know. Business is much the same. But \nconventional wisdom dictates we over-complicate issues because, after all, our world is very complicated \nnow. The Internet, personal computers and other electronic breakthroughs we wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of 20 \nyears ago give us access to a universe of information we can use. I personally believe that reliance on the \ncomputer can be the single biggest drawback to being a high performance entrepreneur. But even I got on- \nline in April 2001, because it has become an integral part of all our personal and business lives. \n\n\nForget what others think. \n\n\nToo many worry more about what others will think about their decision than they do the wisdom \nof the decision itself. What are the guys I play golf with going to think? What will obnoxious cousin Rudy \nsay? Or Aunt Martha who has cartons of Amway products in her garage? Come on, do you think Bill Gates \ngives a hoot what others think? You think Trump gives a damn for the opinions of \u201cexperts\u201d making a fraction \nof his money? Of course he doesn\u2019t. The fact is, you should have all the data you need to make a decision. \nYou\u2019ve done your investigation and due diligence. You\u2019ve met and sized up the other players. Somewhere \ndeep inside, your gut tells you this is an opportunity you need to seize. \n\n\nIn contrast, the high performance person such as myself measures the risks, makes the decision, \ntakes action . . . and never thinks, \u201cWell, maybe I should have done this or that. Maybe I made a mistake. \" \nAs a high performance person, you have the confidence in your judgment to stand by whatever decision you \nmake. And you've got more to do than second-guess yourself. You've got other important decisions - so you \nmove on. Without looking back.

We have the capacity to make mid-course corrections. We experience pivotal, life- \nchanging events. Men, for example, can be changed forever by the experience of war. Women are often \ntransformed by the experience of childbirth. \n\n\nIn this chapter I want to trace the path of my own career and its pivotal points of change. When \nyou understand the origins of my business strategies, you'll see more clearly how you can apply them to your \nbusiness. \n\n\nIwasnotalwaysthe laserbeam-focused, goal-driven success-motivated individual I am today. Quite \nthe contrary, I spent my adolescent years in a tough predominantly Latino East Los Angeles neighborhood, a \n\"barrio\" where you learned street-level survival skills early. Our main competitive sport was bar fights with \nguys from other neighborhoods. Three of my closest friends were Reuben Mu\u00f1oz, Walt Wojak and Howard \nStein. By 15, we were laser beam-focused alright - on perfecting our 9-ball pool, getting drunk and getting \nlaid. The last I knew of Reuben, he was serving a life sentence in Florida's Raiford Prison for murder. \n\n\nThe Pe\u00f1as had migrated from Spain to Mexico. My grandfather rode with Pancho Villa. In the \nonly photo we have of him, he even looks like Villa, complete with drooping mustache. \n\n\nMy father, Manuel S. \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430, was a Los Angeles cop. When he came home, he was a stern \ndisciplinarian, which means he beat the hell out of me when I screwed up. The house we lived in was long \nago boarded up and then torn down after it became a crack house for local drug dealers. \n\n\nMy parents tried to get me into a better environment, so I wound up attending Reseda High \nSchool, in the San Fernando Valley north of LA. But the seeds of rebellion were already planted. I caused a lot \nof trouble during the times when I bothered to attend. In May, 1963, about three weeks before graduation, the \nVice Principal gave three of us our diplomas and told us never to set foot on campus again. They were afraid \nwe'd disrupt graduation. Reuben, Walt and I thought about it awhile, then went back and threw our diplomas \nin the guy's face. Three weeks later, we disrupted graduation on schedule! \n\n\nIn the fall, 1 entered San Fernando Valley State College. Today it is California State University at \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0421 \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nChapter 2 *'Ihe Barrio...and the Castle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"gl \n\n\nNorthridge. I soon flunked out, and drifted through a couple of other colleges over the next two years. \n\n\nFinally, in June 1966, with no goals or ambitions, I enlisted in the Army. My father had been an \nenlisted man during World War II, and an officer during the Korean War. He gave me some good advice. \u2018As \nlong as you are going to be in the military,\u2019 he said, \u2018be an officer.\u2019 By December, 1966, I was attending \nOfficer Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and I earned my Second Lieutenant's bars on July 1, \n1967. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe military proved to be my \nfirst life-changing experience... \nan organization that depended \non personal responsibility and \ndiscipline to be effective. \n\n\nLike so many Army \u201cbrown bars\u201d in '67, I \ncould anticipate becoming an Infantry Platoon Leader \nin Vietnam. Then, for some reason long since buried in \nthe Pentagon, I was suddenly transferred to the Military \nPolice Corps, and shipped to Ft. Gordon, Georgia. \n\n\nBy October I was on my way to Europe, \nattached to NATO as an officer in the 64\" Military Police \nCompany. For the next two years, at stations all over \nGermany, my responsibilities expanded beyond the usual MP duties. I found myself traveling back and forth \nthrough Checkpoint Charlie, involved in various intelligence assignments. It was heady stuff for a brash \n\n\n\n\n\nyoung lieutenant. I loved it. \n\n\nThe military proved to be my first life-changing experience. I became part of an organization that \ndepended on personal responsibility and discipline in order to be effective. Just as it has done for countless \nother young men before and since, the military took an aimless kid and forged a rapidly maturing adult. \n\n\nIntelligence work led me into the guts of real life geopolitics. I saw that there were no real friends \nin the arena of world diplomacy - only allies of convenience. No acts of benevolence - only strategies which \nadvanced one\u2019s best interests. The instinctive tactics of survival, which had served me so well in the barrio, \nwere the same ones nations were using as instruments of policy. Later, when I entered the business world, I \ndiscovered that corporate America operated the same way. By that time, I had been well trained. \n\n\nI separated from the Army in late'69, and returned to civilian life, determined to make up for lost \ntime. I en-rolled in Cal State at Northridge and earned my degree in two and a half years, averaging 20 units \na semester. My final semester I made on the Dean's List with a 3.6 GPA while taking 23 units, studying like \n\u00e0 man possessed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLu \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\nBegin with Expectations of Super Success \n\n\nI finally received my degree in Business Administration in January, 1971, and, while I worked \non my Masters degree in finance and waited to get into law school on a scholarship, I got a job with Land \nConsultants of America, a commercial real estate firm in LA. We were selling land to people interested in \ninvesting in the California dream. Kelly Norwood, the guy I worked for said, \"Dan, you should sell everybody \nwho comes through the door.\" Hell, I didn't know any better, so I achieved a 94.6% closing rate, and felt \nbadly about the other 5.4% who got away. \n\n\nThis experience was an important lesson about expectations. I expected to sell everybody who \nwalked in the door, so I almost did. But what if my boss had said, \u201cDan, real estate is tough. A new guy like \nyou should expect to sell no more than 30%...\u201d My expectation for success would have been less than one- \nthird my real potential! \n\n\nIn April, my boss sent me to become Sales Manager of the San Diego office. The first thing I \ndid was fire every mooch in the office. Then I recruited a sales force of Navy pilots who were getting out \nof service at the San Diego Naval Air Station. These were shit-hot fighter jocks, Top Guns who had earned \ntheir wings in the skies over Southeast Asia. They were assassins in every sense of the word. And I was their \nleader. \n\n\nI told them how easy it was to sell civilians on the California dream. \u2018You ought to be able to sell \neverybody who walks in the door\u2019, I said. Then I proceeded to train my fired-up team of jocks, and I only had \nto shift their mindset marginally to turn them into real estate assassins. By the summer I was making $10,000 \na month in sales commissions! \n\n\nSo even with all this activity, I was flying back and forth to LA where I was a commuting graduate \nstudent. \n\n\nIn late 1971, I decided to start fishing with nets instead of poles, conducting real estate seminars. \nInstead of training just a few staff people, I was teaching roomfuls of hopeful real estate magnates how to \npeddle dirt - and charging them for the privilege. By December of 71, I was driving my first Rolls Royce, and \nhad a Mercedes for a second car. I had long since dropped out of graduate school, and forgotten my pursuit \nofa law degree. \n\n\nIn early * 72, I was named company Vice President. Life was beautiful. I started thinking about \n\n\nmarriage and shopping for a big home in Lake Encino, a sort of quasi-Beverly Hills community in Los \nAngeles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(20) \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\u0442\u044b\u0448\u043b 2 ": "arie DUIS IU \u0448\u0435 \u043c\u044d\u0446\u0435 \n\"gl n \n\nThen the bottom fell out.

The IRS has shut us down.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIraced back to find our office sealed with yellow tape like some sort of crime scene. My partners had \ndecided to skip paying withholding taxes. There was an IRS investigation, and I was cleared of wrongdoing, \nbut was also unemployed. \n\n\nI got a job in LA as a stockbroker at the firm which would later become Paine Webber. In the \nsummer of '72, I was sent to New York City. I got an apartment in Manhattan, and spent invaluable time \nlearning the financial business in the toughest, most unforgiving business environment in the world. Ideally, \nevery individual pursuing success in the top of his or her industry should come to New York City and master \ntheir executive skills. Sinatra was right. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. \n\n\nI made it by all conventional definitions. For five years straight I doubled my income. But it \nwasn't until 1976 that I was transformed from a micro thinker to a macro thinker, and began to redefine my \nown success. (The one man, who turned me around, Jim Newman, became one of my mentors, a concept \nwe'll discuss in a later chapter.) \n\n\nIn late 1977, I left Paine Webber to join the investment banking firm of Bear Stearns & Company \nin Los Angeles where we served as investment bankers and financial advisors for large corporate and private \nclients across the US and overseas. \n\n\nIt was during this period I met a guy by the name of Pat Kennedy. Pat was an oil trader. He made \nhis money moving thousands of barrels or crude oil around in an uncertain oil market. I was intrigued. Then in \n1979 came the second oil crisis, as Saudi Arabia cut its production to boost prices. I had seen a lot of idiots get \nrich during the oil embargo of '73. I quickly decided to make my own ton of money this time around. More \nimportantly, I recognized opportunity when it came along! I've long felt that we all have many opportunities \npresented to us in life, doorways that suddenly open and give us a glimpse of what we could achieve. But \nbecause we're so pre-conditioned, and so fearful of failure, we stand there each time telling ourselves to let \nthe doorway close, rationalizing our inability to take action. Then the doorway closes forever. \n\n\nIleft Bear Stearns in February 1979 to become president of Kennedy Industries in Los Angeles. We \nhandled investments in real estate, entertainment, oil and gas. By entertainment, I mean we found investors \nto co-underwrite movies, usually in return for getting to rub shoulders, and other parts, with rising and eager \nyoung starlets. I knew as much about filmmaking as I did about the oil industry, and we lost a bundle of \nmoney, but we sure as hell had a good time! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1980, we formed JPK Industries. I was CEO, President and 50% owner.

We were running oil and gas exploration and drilling operations, production, crude oil refining and \nmarketing. \n\n\nThe decision to go into the oil business, even though I knew not a damn thing about oil, was one \nof those pivotal points in my career. It didn\u2019t matter that I didn\u2019t know the oil business. My accrued business \nskills, my years of financial management and my confidence in being able to focus those abilities on oil \nindustry problems were impetus enough. Besides, if it didn\u2019t work out, \u0413\u0430 been unemployed before. \n\n\nIt did work out for a while and we made a lot of money. It was during this period that I met a \n| gentleman named Constantine Gratsos. \u201cCosta\u201d was in his eighties at the time, near the end of a life spent \nas the chief lieutenant and confidante of the billionaire shipping legend Aristotle Onassis. By the time I met \nCosta, his old friend had died, and from his suite of offices at the top of the 52-floor Olympic Towers in \nManhattan, he oversaw the sprawling Onassis empire. Costa took a liking to me, and he became my mentor. \nHe called me his \u201coil expert\u201d, and whenever he needed to talk about shipping oil in his tankers anywhere in \nthe world, he summoned me to his office. \n\n\nThrough Costa, I found myself traveling the world, negotiating oil deals with such figures as \nImelda Marcos in the Philippines, \u201cBaby Doc\u201d Duvalier in Haiti and Chile\u2019s military strongman General \nAugusto Pinochet. Whenever I was in Manhattan, I'd work out of Christina Onassis\u2019 office in the Towers. \n\n\nThis was all an intoxicating experience for a 35-year-old wise-assed oil industry novice. It also led \nto probably the most unlikely international adventure of my life, one which for years was a closely held secret \nfor reasons which will soon become apparent. Looking back to write about it so many years later, it almost \nseems like a dream - or a late-night B-movie. To my family, was a nightmare of apprehension... a living hell \nof dark plans and shadowy figures of which she only has frightening memories. \n\n\nHaiti was known to have oil deposits, but oil had never been produced there because of lack of \nexpertise and capital. Although Costa was negotiating with Duvalier for oil shipping rights, he detested \u201cBay \nDoc's\" tyranny, and how he kept his nation impoverished while he moved tens of millions of dollars into his \nown private Swiss bank accounts. \n\n\nCosta, in the finest Greek tradition, was a fierce believer in democracy. So in early 1980, he \ndecided simply to remove the Duvalier regime. Although he conceded that thousands of people could be \nkilled during an armed invasion, he calmly justified his idea with \u0430 rationale that usually began, \u2018When human \nrights are at stake, sacrifices are required...\" \n\n\n\n\n\nL Using his enormous wealth, leverage and influence, Costa convinced three very unlikely parties to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nChapter 2 *'The Barrio...and the Castle \ngl p \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[- co-finance and support an armed invasion of the island nation - the CIA, Mobil Oil and the Vatican. Mobil \u041e\u0439 \nwould in turn get an exclusive on the oil market there, while the Vatican was interested in re-establishing the \ninfluence of the Church. One day I was sitting in a planning meeting in Costa's office, when he turned to me \nand said something to the effect of, \u201cMr. Pe\u00f1a, you were in the Army, weren t you? You were in Intelligence, were \nyou not?\" Yes, I had been, I admitted. \u201cWell, why don t I put you in charge of this project?\u201d Immediately, and \nwith all the enthusiasm could muster, I responded, \u201cYes sir! Absolutely! I'll be honored to lead this project.\u201d \n\n\nEvents moved quickly. Through Costa, I met representatives of the co-conspirators, including the \nCEO of Mobil Oil. Costa reassured me, \u201cMr: Pe\u00f1a, you have my assurance you can trust all these parties - \nexcept one...the Vatican. Don t trust the Vatican, Mr Pe\u00f1a.\u201d \n\n\nThrough the end of 1980 and well into '81, we plunged ahead, with meticulous plans greased by \nenormous resources. Using French contacts, we recruited and armed and an assault force of some 300 mercenaries \nand assassins. We hired the special talents of the very best freelance demolition's expert, and brought in a widely \nrespected mercenary, Colonel Mike Williams, who had served as the last commander of the Rhodesian Cavalry. \nThese were men who had lived and fought on civilization's underbelly for so long they seemed to squint in the \nincandescence of normal society. They chatted idly about \u201cjobs\u201d in Angola or the Congo or the Bolivian jungle, \nand \"getting trigger time\" in ferocious firefights. Just beyond their quiet talk you could almost hear the rattle of \nautomatic weapons fire and smell the sweat of war. \n\n\nThey brought to life the clich\u00e9, \u201c\u0430 breed apart\". \n\n\nDuring our spending spree, we also acquired a couple of Army surplus helicopter gun ships through \ndubious channels, and a Vietnam-era C-47 \u201cPuff the Magic Dragon.\" This unlikely killer, designed for \u201ctarget \nSuppression,\u201d was mounted with three updated Gatling guns, General Electric 7.62mm \u201cmini-guns,\u201d each \nmounted and firing from the port side. \n\n\nTen or fifteen of the project\u2019s top leadership, myself included, were spirited by the CIA into Camp \nCobray, an anti-terrorist school run by Lt. Gen. Mitchell Werbell in Powder Springs, Georgia. Working with CIA \nSpecialists, we practiced hand-to-hand combat, and negotiated obstacle courses under live fire. We also became \nSkilled sharp-shooters. We went beyond aiming a weapon and learned to fire by instinct. I got to be such a good \nShot, I could almost toss a dime into the air and hit it. \n\n\nThe plan was to launch overland from the Dominican Republic, with air support, and with the \nelement of total surprise, blow up the Presidential Palace and the Federal Reserve of Haiti, where Duvalier had \nStashed $200 million. We would liberate that money for our troubles, and then install a new president already \nSelected by leaders of the Haitian community in the US. You see, we were 15 years ahead of Bill Clinton! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we were only 300 strong, our battle plan called for expending a million rounds or \nammunition during the first day of the assault! Thousands, including the Palace Guard and most of Haiti\u2019s \nfeared ton-ton macoute, would be terminated. It never even occurred to us that we might be killed as well. We \nwere immortal in those days. In fact, I made sure I was slated to be aboard the first chopper to hit the ground in \nthe palace grounds! \n\n\nIn the meantime, our designated president-to-be was sitting in New York drawing up a hit list of \nhis enemies. It grew from a dozen to hundreds. And the CIA was getting nervous that our plan was becoming \nless than a clean, surgical strike. During the summer of 1981, a climactic meeting was held in Olympic Towers, \nattended by our new CIA contacts, our mercenary commanders and other key players. Suddenly the CIA guys \nannounced they were shutting down the operation. \n\n\nTalk about chaos! The mercenaries jumped up and pulled their guns, the CIA guys jumped up and \ndrew their guns, and my own former FBI bodyguard, Dave Reynolds, shoved me under the conference table. At \nthat moment, Costa strolled into the room, glanced around and said, \u2018It looks like I got here just in time for the \n\n\nexcitement\u2019. \n\n\nOnce guns were re-holstered - and I came out from under the table - we accepted the fact that the CIA \nhad pulled out of the deal. Then they added, should our mission fail and we were captured, they would deny all \nknowledge of us and the project. And, oh yes, they were keeping the money. Now we were furious. I told them \nto get the hell out, that we were going to hit Haiti without them. \n\n\nWeeks later, I was bound from L.A. to the Dominican Republic, with a stopover at Miami International. \nEvery element was in place. I had a message waiting for me in Miami that if we insisted on proceeding with the \noperation, that every leader would be whacked by the CIA. We would just disappear without a trace. \n\n\nThe project was dropped. And my friend and mentor Costa Gratsos passed away peacefully a short \ntime thereafter. \n\n\nIt finally emerged that no less than Jimmy Carter\u2019s Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, had squashed \nthe project. Years later, at the wedding of one of our conspirators, I ran into Cyrus Vance in the receiving line. I \nintroduced myself, and said, \u201cYou really screwed me, Cy. \" The man was taken aback, of course, but said nothing \nas I continued, \u201cYou owe me, Cy. Haiti, 1981, remember?\u201d \n\n\nHe stared back and never said a word. \n\n\nBy the way, the Vatican pledged $250,000 to the project. And I learned then and there that when \na mega-successful mentor warns that you're about to get screwed, you either heed his advice or bend over. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0430 \n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nChapter 2 *The Barrio...and the Castle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[qe \n\n\nds of \nfaiti\u2019s \n1.

Ask Bill Gates about universal software. Ask Netscape about Web browsers. How many short \nyears ago was it that \u201cGoogle\u201d was a theoretical number beloved only by nerds... that Dell was a publisher of comic \nbooks!.... and \"Yahoo\" was something cowboys yelled during sex. \n\n\nWith a growing network of contacts and sources in the oil industry, I decided to go into business for \nmyself. So on Friday, July 13, 1982, I founded Great Western Development Corporation (GWDC). At least I'd never \n_ be fired again, right? \n\n\n) When you're looking to increase revenues quickly, who are \u045b\u0435 dumbest people to do business with? \nIe E Corrente the U.S. Government. I immediately contacted the Defense \nuel Service Center, US Department of Defense. This agency bids out contracts every February and October to buy \n\n\n\n\n\nover. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(X) \n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\nP We started GWDC with $1000. A fiend of mine, Bob Anderson, retired Texas oilman and former} \nSecretary of the Navy, chipped in $180, and I paid the remaining $820 to bid an initial $20 million contract. (I later \npaid Bob back his \u201cinvestment\u201d.) I was working in my infant son\u2019s bedroom, with a spare telephone and a leased fax \nmachine. That was the total extent of Great Westem Development Corporation. \n\n\nThe Beauties of a Joint Venture: Other People\u2019s Money...and Other People \n\n\nBut not even the government does business with a company they've never heard of, with no track record. \nThat's when I put together my first joint venture. I tracked down Marrion Refining Company, located in Mobile, a firm \nthat currently had an excess fuel capacity. That means they had more time to refine crude than they had crude coming \nin to refine. The head of Marrion was a retired Army man, so we struck up a relationship based on our common \nmilitary background. \n\n\nFor the paper-shufflers at the DFSC, Marrion Refining was a known entity. Partnering Great Western with \nMarrion gave us an instant track record. As a result we landed three fuel contracts totaling $50 million. Now, with \ngovernment contracts in hand, GWDC was on its way. Suddenly, we were perceived as a company to do business \nwith. And, as you've heard over and over, perception is reality! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven today, I tell audiences, \u201cWith $820, a phone and \na leased fax machine in my kid bedroom, I landed a $50 million \ncontract and launched a company ultimately worth $400 million\u201d \nEverybody sees or hears that figure and says \u201cWow!\u201d But you \n\n\nOver the years, I've used \nOther People\u2019s Money \n\n\n(OPM) and Other People \n\n\nto continuously grow my know what - nobody ever asks me how much the company made \npany and make millions. on that $50 million. The answer is just $90,000. \n\n\n\n\n\nBut how much of my own money did I spend? A thousand dollars. And who did I use to inflate my \ncompany's profile far beyond its meager size? Other people, with other skills, other contacts and greater reputations. \nOver the years, I\u2019ve used Other People\u2019s Money (\u201cOPM\u201d) and Other People continuously to grow my company and \nmake millions. We'll talk about locating that money and those people in future chapters. \n\n\nAt the time I founded Great Western I set three goals for myself: \na) to grow the company to $2 billion in assets", " \nb) to become one of the top five highest paid energy executives in the country": null, " and... \n\n\n\u20ac) to make Great Western Resources the 50\" largest energy company in the country.

I fell $1.55 billion short of the first goal, measured in market capitalization and \nvalue. But so what? And what if I had set my goal at $20 billion in assets? \n\n\nI learned a lesson I wouldn't forget about setting goals too low. \n\n\nAfter our initial successes, GWDC entered what I call a nurturing period. I decided to nurture my company \nby selling tax shelters. Remember - this was 1982. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was still four years away. Both \nindividual and institutional investors were clamoring for tax shelters. And chaos, my favorite business condition, ruled \nthe market. \n\n\nI had no broker or dealer's license which would enable me to sell tax shelters, so I formed yet another \njoint venture - with a brokerage firm run by one of the best salesman I\u2019ve ever met. His name was Walter Levine, and \nhe sold me a three-year tax shelter on $1.5 million in income. When I protested, he said, \"Trust me, You'll grow into \nit\". What a guy. \n\n\nWalter and I formed a little joint venture we called G&J. It wasn't on our business cards, but G&J stood \nfor \u201cGoy and Jew\u201d. We launched our first tax shelter venture in December 1982, in the form of an oil drilling fund. \n\n\nOver the next two years, GWDC put together - and G&J sold three very successful tax shelters. The \nOperating capital from the funds came in the form of general and administrative fees payable to GWDC. During those \ntenuous times when we couldn\u2019t afford the best New York lawyers and accountants, we got them anyway. How we \nhired them is a secret revealed in another chapter. \n\n\nOne California day in 1983, while I was running, the idea struck me to buy a castle I couldn\u2019t afford. \nYes. ..a medieval castle on an island. The ultimate in ostentation. We were doing well with our tax shelters, but we \nStill needed the help of Wall Street to remain successful. And, as I knew from my own Wall Street experience, if you \nwanted to do business with financial institutions, you had to prove to them you didn't need their services. My own \ncastle would certainly make that perception a reality in their minds. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo...a castle became my goal. \n\n\nIt's critically important here to understand that my goal was indeed my total focus. But we'll get to that \ndiscussion later. \n\n\nBy the following Thanksgiving, I was shopping for castles in the United Kingdom. During this period, \nbusiness coincidentally brought me to London a few times, giving me more opportunities to browse the castle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRE \n\n\n\n\n\nThen, one June morning in 1984, I drove through the ancient stone gates of Guthrie Castle, located in \nCounty Tayside, Angus, Scotland about five miles from the rocky cliffs of the North Sea. \n\n\nGuthrie, dating from the 1460s, is a 55-room manor home, complete with turrets and a great stone tower. \nAt its top, open parapets, built for defense against : \nother clans and no doubt the English, look out across \na formal walled garden in the shape of a Celtic cross, \nand the forested countryside. Endless corridors and \nhigh-ceilinged rooms almost echo the booted steps of \nfive centuries of Guthries - and no castle is complete \nwithout a ghost. Guthrie has a ghost maiden who \nappears periodically, in addition to other sightings. \n\n\n\n\n\nAdding to its appeal, Guthrie is surrounded \nby 156 acres of rolling estate, icy streams and a crystal \nloch. Perfect for my own golf course, I thought. I made \nmy first offer within days. After negotiations, I made my final offer in August, which was accepted. \n\n\nThe interior had been stripped of every stick of furniture and decoration. Even the fireplace mantles had \nbeen yanked out for auction to pay taxes. The castle was destined to be razed had I not bought it. It took a year living \nin chaos to rewire, replumb, reroof, renovate, refurnish and decorate the place in time for my 40\" birthday party in \nAugust, 1985. \n\n\nI made \u0430 lot of local antique dealers and decorators wealthy during that yearlong buying spree! The result \nis an historic castle that is at once an elegant showcase of fine d\u00e9cor, and a warm sanctuary in the gentle hills of Angus. \nAs far as the island the dream castle would occupy, Guthrie indeed stood on an island - the isle of Great Britain! \n\n\nIt occurred to me how far I had come during my first 40 years. From a Latino punk in the hard streets of \nan urban barrio... to the laird of my own castle in the peaceful Scottish countryside. Here, secluded in such timeless \nsurroundings, I could ride my Arabians or just walk the grounds in the crisp northern air, renewing my strength and \nspirit. \n\n\nI would need that strength. For the greatest adventure of my life had just begun. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0437 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Three \n\n\nConventional Wisdom - the Loser's Crutch \n\n\n\u2018Do business the way it\u2019s usually done, if you're satisfied making the \nusual money the usual morons do.\u2019 \n\n\nLenin was wrong. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Conventional wisdom - not religion- is the opium of the people.

So \nhow the hell do you suppose we all have common sense? There is no \u201ccommon sense!\u201d \n\n\nIn this chapter, while I continue the Great Western story, you'll see how I constantly flew in the \nface of conventional wisdom. We'll also begin discussing my Seven Steps for Super Success, and how to \ncreate your personal foundation to build that success. \n\n\nBuilding Your Personal Foundation \n\n\nBefore you can create and run a super successful company, you have to re-create yourself. You \nhave to cleanse your mind of years of conventional wisdom, and in the void that's left, build a personal \nfoundation based on all new rules. \n\n\nThe first New Rule is an old one: there are no rules. Rules by definition are limiters - walls beyond \n\n\nwhich you don't allow yourself to venture. Rules, even P a \nY \u0423 Your own \u0442\u0456\u043f\u0430, pre-conditioned \n\n\nyour own, put you into a self-imposed box with four \u00a9 \u0436\u0430\u0439\u044b \u0443 : \nby conventional thinking, is your \n\n\nsides. To become super successful, you've got to think \noutside the box. \n\n\ngreatest limiting factor. \n\n\n\n\n\nYour own mind is your greatest limiting \nfactor. There's where all the \u201cYou can't do that\" crap will gather to smother your creativity and cloud your \nvision. If you're my age, you remember when the four-minute mile was \"impossible.\" Nobody had ever \ndone it. Then, on May 6, 1954, an English runner, Roger Bannister, finished the mile in 3.59.4 minutes. The \nvery next month, Australian John Landy did it in 3.57.9. Soon a growing list of runners were conquering the \n\"impossible\" four- minute mile. Beyond challenge of time and distance, however, was the destruction of the \nmental barrier that cleared the way to conquest. \n\n\n\n\n\nk This story has powerful implications for anyone striving for super success. Often the \u201cimpossible\u201d 24 \n[2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nCnapter \u044d *\\Lonventionat vvisaom - 1ne Loser s ruten \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc business is a feat that hasn't been attempted. It takes guts to move beyond the known into the unknown. \n\n\nOne of the legends of Asia was a Russian hotelier named Boris Lissanevitch. Trained in his \nyouth as a ballet dancer, he escaped Russia during the Bolshevik revolution and became a world-class dance \nperformer. While touring the cities of the Orient, he fell under the spell of Asia, settled in Calcutta to run a \nrestaurant, and in 1951 decided to open the first hotel in the Kingdom of Nepal. His friends in India advised \nhim it would be impossible. After all, they pointed out, his landlocked Himalayan nation was still stuck in \nthe 15\" Century. It was the mythical Shangri La, tucked beneath the world's highest mountain range with no \ntelephones, and access to the outside world only by perilous air travel ending on a rough grassy \u201crunway\u201d \noutside Kathmandu. \n\n\nWith no roads leading in or out of the kingdom, the only automobile in Nepal belonged to King \nTribhuvan. Boris was not to be deterred. He bought a rambling, rundown medieval palace. He brought the \nsecond car into the country overland through the jungle from northern India using porters, disassembling it \ninto dozens of parts, and re-assembling it on arrival in Kathmandu. \n\n\nFrom Calcutta, he ordered modern plumbing fixtures, power generators, refrigeration units, \nfurnishings and all the other trimmings to turn a dilapidated palace into a first-class tourist hotel. Since \nNepalese cuisine consists of rice soup and curry (as Hindus they eat no meat no drink liquor), Boris also had \nto air-freight in all food and drink. \u2018Jt simply can t be done, 'they continued to sniff back in India. \n\n\nToday, the most prestigious address in Nepal is the Hotel Yak & Yeti. Host to royalty and celebrity \nguests for decades, it is a splendid testimony to the sheer guts of the late Boris Lissanevitch, regarded as the \nfather of tourism in Nepal. \n\n\nIt takes guts to lead the charge...and guts to change. Suppose you've got a good business deal \nclinched, and the possibility of a better one comes along. All around you, conventional wisdom chirps, \u2018Don t \nblow this. Remember, a bird in the hand... 'It takes guts to ignore the advice of the tip-toers and meek-minded, \nand go for the better deal. If you\u2019ve got a good product that\u2019s selling well, it takes guts to throw it out to \nintroduce an even better product. \n\n\nIt Doesn\u2019t Matter What the Morons Say \n\n\nI don\u2019t often pay attention to what others think - especially morons. Several years ago, in the box \nOffice hit Evita, Madonna in the title role sings, \u201cIt doesn t matter what the morons say...\" My definition of \na moron or a doofus (pronounced \u201cdoo-fus\u201d) is anybody whose advice or attitude would limit my success \nPotential. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n| Your First 100 Million \n\n\ngl p \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorons are everywhere. They work with you, they commute with you, go to your health club, live \nnext door, and are even in your family. They've limited their thinking and would feel much more comfortable \nif you'd limit yours too. \n\n\nYou probably even pay for conventional wisdom. Some professions exist to keep you in the box \nof *how it's done,\" and typically attract very careful and conservative men and women with buttoned-down \nminds. You've got a company doing several million dollars in business, for example, but you entrust your \naccounting and tax functions to a CPA (accountant) who has no more vision than to happily earn $70,000 a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear. Even worse, you pay this furrow-browed bean counter, not to be creative, but to shake his finger in your \nface on behalf of the government and say, \u2018You can t do that!\u2019 After all, accountants are trained and certified \nto follow studiously rules that help the IRS get every dime they can of your money, in a large part by making \nI sure you think conventionally about your income tax. \n\n\nYou also risk the danger of retaining a lawyer whose conventional wisdom is focused on what you \n| cannot do. This guy sure isn't going to clear you a path to pursue your objective", " he's more afraid you'll take \n| an unconventional step that'll make his job harder. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Over the course of my career, I've listened to the advice of scores of lawyers and accountants. I \nrespect their knowledge. Some have been my partners. But with few exceptions I know they are conventional \npeople dosing-out conventional counsel on how to tiptoe even when my strongest instincts and inclinations \ntell me it's time to stampede...time to kick ass! \n\n\nMorons and doofuses travel in other guises too - stockholders, bankers, the press and, thankfully, \nthe competition. All that conventional wisdom can make a lot of noise if you're behaving unconventionally. \n\n\nThat's why, when you operate under New Rules, you don't give a damn if you repeatedly embarrass \nyourself. By the way, in the beginning this isn't easy. One pearl of conventional wisdom reminds us that we \ndon't want to embarrass ourselves by failing at anything. You just keep saying to yourself, \u201cJt doesn t matter \nwhat the morons say.\" \n\n\nNew Habits... New Companions \n\n\nNew Rules need the support of new habits and new companions. Two of the most dynamic \nbusiness people I know are George and Deann Verdier. They own Sugarloaf Mountain Works in Gaithersburg, \nMaryland. They were already successful when they attended my Castle Experience in 1994. I hold this highly \nconcentrated weeklong seminar once or twice a year at my 15* Century home in Scotland. It is limited to six \ncouples, and has launched more than a few Quantum Leaps in recent years.

You may have seen the movie, Sophie's Choice. The \nchoice that the lead character played by Meryl Streep, had to make was between saving the life of her son or \nthat of her daughter. Now that\u2019s a tough decision! But for day-to-day business, it's a good way to put decision- \nmaking in perspective. Ask yourself \u2018Will anybody die as a result of my decision?\u2019 Whether you're deciding \non whom to hire as a Sales Manager... or how much office space you need... or which markets you're going \nto expand into... or the color of your office walls - nobody\u2019 life is threatened if you make the wrong decision. \nIt just not a life-or-death thing. You may lose some money. You may experience some inconvenience. Your \nmooch \u201cfriends\u201d may scoff. But so what! The most so-called \u201cimportant\u201d decision you will ever make doesn't \ncause a ripple in the cosmos of time. The earth won't tremble in its orbit if you screw it up. And, unless you're a \nbrain surgeon or a cardiologist doing a bypass operation, nobody is going to die based on what you decide. The \nnext time you find yourself agonizing over a business decision, ask yourself, \u2018Is this a Sophie 5 Choice? 'If the \nanswer is no, make the decision! \n\n\nAnother new habit is to listen to legitimate warnings. Who can give you a legitimate warning? \nSomebody who's been there. If you're trying to find capital to finance your business, listen to somebody \nwho's already borrowed capital. If you're about to take on a partner, listen to his or her past partners. Listen to \nexperience - not excrement! And don t listen to some seminar bum who's never run a legitimate business in his \nlife. Or if he has, it was a pushcart to nowhere. \n\n\nYour new personal foundation must include a New Rule about risk. We've talked about risk earlier. \nConventional wisdom says, \u2018Be careful!\u2019 But risk is absolutely necessary in order to become super successful. \nThink of it this way - you're not taking a chance - you're making a chance! \n\n\nYour risk may even be a bit crazy. Most big risks in this world were once called crazy - sailing off \nwest to find India... trying to make a heavier-than-air machine actually fly...putting a man on the moon...So be \ncrazy. Just know the difference between taking a crazy risk and a stupid one. And go for it with confidence. As \nI\u2019ve said for years, \u201c\u0422 may be wrong - but I\u2019m never in doubt.\u2019 \n\n\nGetting back to those tax shelters that Walter Levine was selling as G&J, we set as our goal a $5.5 \nmillion package. We only raised $1.4 million, closing the deal on New Year's Eve 1982. Tax shelters in those \ndays were a dime a dozen, so we had to make each one of ours be perceived to be bigger and better than the last. \nOur second drilling fund venture raised $3.4 million... and our third, in December 1983, raised $5.4 million. \n\n\nOur office in Palos Verdes, California was continually expanding, so that by early 1984, we occupied \n2000 square feet of space with only six employees. These plush, spacious offices gave investors the perception \n\n\nin 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nAMA reri) AH venienti \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430\u043d Arit \u0448\u0443\u0434\u044b \u043e So \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0430. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE. a large, prosperous firm. \n\n\nOur research told us that the Denver-Julesburg (D-J) Basin, in northeast Colorado, held rich promise \nas an oil field. Using funds from our third tax shelter, we agreed to drill 24 wells in the D-J Basin. Then we \ndecided to take the deal public. In March 1984, we purchased a $60,000 six-month option to buy a $2 million \nD-J Basin property with great prospects as an oil field. Then with Great Western's fourth fund venture, we raised \nanother million dollars. Other people's money was about to make us all rich. \n\n\nWith two partners, whom I'll discuss later, I had purchased a small company in the United Kingdom \nin late '83, so I had become somewhat familiar with British business and financial practices. For several reasons, \nwe decided to take Great Western public not on Wall Street, but in the venerable halls of \u201cthe City\", London's \nfinancial heart of the Empire. This proved to be a historic decision, because no one had ever taken an option \npublic in the United Kingdom. So why the UK? \n\n\nWe had practical reasons, of course. Our offering would have been too small to attract interest in \nthe US market, even in normal times. But these were not normal times. You may recall that around 1984, Wall \nStreet was aflame with junk bonds and LBO's generating fees in the tens of millions of dollars. Fees for bankers, \nstockbrokers, accountants and lawyers in the U.K., therefore, were significantly lower. \n\n\nInterest in the oil market itself was at different levels on opposite sides of the Atlantic. While the \nU.S. oil market had been wrung dry and oil was old news, investors in the U.K. had only recently contracted \"oil \nfever\". The first oil had been discovered in the North Sea in 1975, and the British were still enthusiastic about \nexploration. \n\n\nFinally, the regulations applying to such a public offering, especially by a natural resource company, \nWere not as stringent in the U.K. By avoiding Wall Street, we wouldn't have to put up with a lot of bullshit \nrequirements by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\n\nBut one important reason we went to London, which you won't find in any finance textbooks, is \nthe nature of the people who drive the traditional British financial community - insecure, arrogant, chained by \ntradition and perfect targets for a rough and brazen American oilman. In short, they were pussycats! \n\n\nWe decided to go public on my 39\" birthday, August 10, 1984. \u201cYou \u0441\u0430\u043f? do that,\u201d the starchy \nSolicitors of London said, \"Thats the day Jaguar is going public. All the available investment dollars will \n! head for Jaguar, a great British institution being sold off by the government.\" They should have told Jaguar \nthat August 10\" was the day Great Western Resources was going public. By the close of business that first day, \nGWR had 20 million shares outstanding of common stock which closed at about $2.50 a share. Beginning with \n\n\n\n\n\n$60,000 option, the market value of Great Western Resources, with under $100,000 in hard assets, soared \nE \n\n\n\n\n\n(35) \n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto 40 million pounds - or 50 million dollars! And 60% of the outstanding shares were mine! We sold 25% of the\u201d) \ncompany for ten million pounds, and the shares closed at 25% premium to the initial offering price. \n\n\nBottom line: the company had \u00a310 million in the bank and the cost basis in the stock held by \nmyself was $820! \n\n\nNext day\u2019s headline in a London newspaper, referring to Jaguar, read, \u2018Great Western Resources, \nThe One That Really Roared! ' The paper characterized my impact on the market by concluding, \u2018...the most \ncontroversial businessman ever to set foot in London in the Eighties was off and running. ' The next month \nwe moved to Guthrie Castle. \n\n\nWas all this risky stuff? You bet it was! Could we have fallen on our butts? Probably. The secret is, \naside from some astute salesmanship of possible oil-and-gas returns in god-forsaken Colorado, we focused \non the ends - not the means. We thought big and moved fast. And we were confident that we could outsmart \non our dullest day any stiff-upper-lipped, bowler-hated Brit in the City. And so we did. We acted as if we had \nno limits to our abilities, which is one of my Five Credos for Super Success we'll discuss in a later chapter. \nAnother credo relates to \u201centhusiasm\u201d. We sold our deal with the enthusiasm of evangelists, throwing fresh \nmeat into the British feeding frenzy for \u201coil exploration\". It's no different nowadays. Each year there is a new \n\"frenzy\"! As I write, it is Internet companies that are commanding insane multiples of real worth. \n\n\n\u2018Wow, how does this apply to me? \u2018you ask. Listen, I don\u2019t expect you to fly to London tomorrow \nand duplicate our achievement in the City. What about your own company? Your own dream? What about \nthose poker-faced bankers down the street with the imaginations of mud hens? What about investors looking \nfor a great stock in a company that would look like yours - if you gave it a fresh coat of paint and went public? \nIn order to remove Other People's Money from Other People's Pockets to build your dream, you have to \nbuild a gold-leafed perception of value around your company. We'll talk more about that later under Exit \nStrategies. \n\n\nKeep Your Eye on the Vision - and You Won't See the Obstacles \n\n\nLet's talk about what Michael E. Gerber calls the \u201centrepreneurial personality\". In his book, The \nE Myth, Gerber explains that the business owner is really sort of a schizophrenic", " one mind with three \npersonalities in continuous conflict - the entrepreneur, the manager and the technician. While the manager \nwrites business plans and maintains order, and the technician tinkers with the day-to-day work and drives \nemployees nuts, the entrepreneurial personality leaps beyond the present to dream the dreams and focus on \nthe vision of where the company is headed. The entrepreneur is impatient with the present. He's through with \nit.

Gerber says that the entrepreneur who is absorbed in his vision is also impatient with those \n| around him - his associates, his friends, his family, even his other two personalities - because they cannot see \n| the vision and become excited by it.

Eisenhower launched D-Day knowing full well the weather \nwas lousy and seas were rough - and expecting at least a 50% chance of failure. But he played the best cards \nhe had. He actually wrote an apology note and tucked it into his pocket to read to the world should the Allies \nget pushed off the beaches of Normandy into the sea. \n\n\nDuring World War II, arguably the best field general in the last century, George Patton, kept \nhis sights on Berlin and blew tank shells through anything that got in his way. He was impatient with the \nmeticulous planning and plodding of other generals. He said, '4 good plan executed right now is better than \na perfect plan executed next week\u2019. \n\n\nBut back to the story... \n\n\nSo there we were sitting on millions. Meanwhile, our drillers adjourned to the fabulous D-J Basin, \nwhere our illustrious engineers and geologists had told us that \u201cwithout a doubt\" there should be millions of \nbarrels of oil under this wasteland - perhaps... \n\n\nThey drilled a hole. It wasn't dry, but it wasn't what it should\u2019 ve been. They drilled a dozen more. \nNothing to speak of. \n\n\nEventually our high-priced experts reported that virtually the only gas and oil in the area was what \nthey had brought with them in their trucks. Or in the hair of our British advisors. Actually, we might continue \nto strike oil, but not in the quantities we would needed to take a company public. We had the money to drill \nanother 120 wells. But, I thought, for what? \n\n\nIt was at this point I called for a halt in drilling operations. I had long thought that internal growth, \nthrough operating profits, would not give the company the exponential, quantum success of external expansion. \nEven with moderate success, we could watch revenues ease up gradually. Or we could acquire growth, and \nwatch our growth curve shoot straight up. We needed to bump up revenue. \n\n\nMy vision for Great Western told me to go for the latter. That's because the name of the game in \n\n, business is revenue. Lots of revenue. You can control expenses and cut costs all you want and you'll realize \nnickel-and-dime improvements in profitability.

Boredom, anxiety, even fear. And the \ncertain death of any growth potential for your company and most assuredly you! Have you ever seen fear in \nthe eyes of an opponent or enemy? It could have been in the boxing ring, on the football field or even on the \nbattlefield. You're face to face and you see his eyes flinch and dart around in terror, and you say to yourself, \u0443\u0435 \ngot this son-of-a-bitch.

This guy is an embarrassment, because he is clearly out of his comfort zone. \n\n\nHere's my favorite comfort zone illustration. If I were to lay a 10-foot long 2x12\u201d plank on the floor, \nand put a pile of thousand-dollar bills at the other end, and told you that if you walked across the plank you could \nhave the stack of money, you\u2019d scamper across in a second wouldn\u2019t you? \n\n\nWhat if I took that plank up on the third floor, stuck it out the window and over to an adjoining \nbuilding, would you still cross over and pick up your money? Maybe. You might crawl over very carefully on \nyour hands and knees. \n\n\nWhat if I took that plank up to the 27\" floor and stretched it across a narrow alley to a nearby building. \n\u2018Hey, that a long way down, ' you might say. \u2018You think I'm crazy? 'No, you're just out of your comfort zone. \n\n\nBut suppose your darling child was over in the other building, and I doused her with gasoline and \nstruck a match and told you to come over on the plank 27 stories up or else. You'd probably be right over with \nlittle hesitation because of instinctive parental love. \n\n\nThe super successful operate in a different atmosphere than most people. They\u2019re way up there, \n100 stories high, in rare, thin air, and they\u2019re quite comfortable. That\u2019s what you have to be able to do - conduct \nbusiness on that high plank without a blink or fear. And one way to do this is constantly to expose yourself to \nsituations that by definition make you uncomfortable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0430 f \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nSempres a \u043c\u043b\u043d\u0443 MUNJU MULE WEE \u0430\u0438\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0433\u0443\u043e\u0433\u0442\u0448\u043f\u0441\u0435 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to expand your comfort zone. Another and easier way to begin getting comfortable with \nigh performance is through visualization. \n\n\n| One of the best clarifiers is the written word. If you talk about an idea or a plan to a dozen people \nin the same room, you create a dozen interpretations of your plan. But if you write it down, one plan exists for \na dozen readers. \n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, in order to clarify your vision in your own mind, write it on a piece of paper. The act \nof committing to paper takes the ambiguity out of your idea. You see it before \nyou, perhaps for the first time.

I turn \nleft and walk down a long corridor, at least 150 feet, past the offices of associates, until I reach the comer of the \nbuilding.

As my shoes clicked across cool Carrera marble toward the young blond receptionist, \nI felt not so much a feeling of achievement as one of closure... of touching the vision which had already been \nso real for so long. I knew it because I had visualized it down to the smallest detail. It was the fulfillment of a \ndream. It was coming home. \n\n\nArmando Garcia was a successful entrepreneur and a recognized specialist in executive sales \nmanagement long before we met. In August 1990, the company he founded, Arcom Electronics, was cited by \nHispanic Business Magazine as the fastest growing Hispanic-owned company in the country. But in the years \nthat followed, Armando realized that his company could be doing better. So in 2000, he attended the Castle \nSeminar. During that experience, I startled Armando by telling him what he needed most to hear. \n\n\n\u201cWe were all sitting there,\u201d remembers Armando, \u201cwhen Dan suddenly asked me, quite loudly, \u2018If \nyou live in Silicon Valley, why aren't you a billionaire?\u2019 It was at that moment I realized that my set belief \nsystem would only allow me to go so far before slipping into \u2018idle mode.\u2019 I suddenly realized I had to expand \nthat system.\u201d Armando came away from the Castle with the insight he needed to \u201csee his dreams ahead.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnother key lesson I brought home from the Castle was the need for laser focus,\u201d Armando said \nlater. \u201cI immediately applied this lesson to sharpening our product mix and increased our sales by more than \n30%.\u201d \n\n\nAfter he closed Arcom during the dotcom bust, Armando purchased a struggling software company \ncalled Bottlesoft. He subsequently lost about a million dollars and lots of sleep, but has since integrated \nanother \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430-\u0456\u0455\u0442 into his business thinking: /nvestigate before you invest.

Yesterday\u2019s dreams are today\u2019s realities. \n\n\nThis is another way of saying \u201cToday\u2019s dreams are tomorrow\u2019s realities.\u201d Dreams come first, lighting \nand energizing your imagination, and gradually crystallizing into reality. Without dreams, you never progress. \nYou never make any leaps, let alone Quantum Leaps. Instead you trudge through life taking whatever chances \ncome along. Like the song says in the musical South Pacific, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a dream, how you gonna make \nthat dream come true?\u201d \n\n\n2, See your dreams ahead of time now. \n\n\nThis is acall to action. Don't just ta/k about dreaming. Dream! Virtually everything I\u2019ve accomplished \nof any consequence I visualized and dreamed of before it happened. So dream like me about a super successful \nbusiness career filled with sweetheart deals pried from the clutches of morons and their toady lawyers. Dream \nabout a larger home in an exclusive gated community. Dream about a vacation to Tahiti. \n\n\nTake another look at that study a few years back by USA Today. They asked 1500 readers what \nthey daydreamed about when they were at work. Some 77% said they daydreamed about having sex with a \nco-worker, 23% lied and said they did not. Seventy-three percent daydreamed about becoming CEO of their \ncompany, and 69% fantasized about what they\u2019d say to their boss the day they quit. The survey also found that \nOver a twelve-month period, daydreams came true for that group a surprising 71% of \u045b\u0435 time. Why? Because \nthe daydreamer had visualized it over and over and had willed that daydream to come true. So take time to dream \nnow, so that your dreams have a chance of coming to fruition. \n\n\n3. Simulation: Practice within then you\u2019re without. \n\n\nThis goes back to practicing being super successful.

These techniques have been used successfully around the world by individuals \nWho became top executives, champion athletes - and even successful politicians.

For centuries, as an \nexample, the true nature of war was masked in a grand illusion of colorful parades, splendid uniforms and \nflying flags. The warnings of those who returned from war, who quietly described its horror, were lost in the \ntrumpet strains of marching tunes. Only late in this century, when TV news brought the carnage of battle \nhome around dinnertime, did the general public finally realize that all the glory and grandeur was...illusion. \n\n\nIllusion is one of the skills of leadership. \n\n\nIn the epic movie Patton, the fiery general played by the late George C.

It is \nhe stage we set... the costume we don... the face we present to achieve our objectives. Within the bounds \nof law and ethics, illusion is your weapon to build the most advantageous perception you can in the minds \n\nstockholders and stockbrokers, attorneys, competitors and the public at large - all for the accelerating \nvancement of your company. \n\n\n\"But, Dan,\u201d you ask, \"are you suggesting I create illusions about my company?\u201d \n\n\ny You're damn right! You've got to do what it takes! If you run a business, your job as head of your \nnpany goes well beyond making sure it produces a top quality product or service and sells it at a fair price. \nYou've got to spend days and nights continuously pumping credibility into the facade that your company \nrepresents to the business community... to make it appear on the business skyline not simply as large as it is, \n(a hell of a lot bigger... and infinitely nicer to do business with. \n\n\nThe importance of perception was not lost on the Chinese government during the 2008 Olympiad \nBeijing. Thousands of factories around the city burn cheap, dirty anthracite coal with no thought of the \nedible pollution it creates. Diesel trucks and buses and an explosion in private car ownership have helped \nBeijing\u2019s sky into a perpetual brown haze. The foreign community laughingly calls it \u201cmorning fog\u201d or \nhuric sunset.\u201d Sports trainers and sponsors around the world hinted they might pull out of the Olympics \nthan subject athletes to breathing the brown. The government said not to worry. \n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, many of the manicured avenues leading into Beijing from the new billion-dollar \npassed by the crumbling old villages, waste dumps and slums that are part of any Asian capital.

Some \ningest factories were literally pulled up and relocated hundreds of miles from Beijing, so that they \nnlessly pollute the countryside, Other factories across Beijing were simply shut down for 10 days \nment decree. Owners of private vehicles with odd and even-ending license plates were ordered to \nme every other day, to carpool \u2014 or enter the city at risk of heavy fine.

Beijing was suddenly neither a city under construction nor a city \n\n\nin decline. But just about perfect in every way. \n\n\nIn China, if the government tells you not to spit and where to shit, you listen. In advance of the \nOlympics, a public relations blitz warned Beijingers not to spit, not to cheat \"foreign friends\" or offend them \n\u0456\u043f any way. Basic English phrases were drilled into taxi drivers, bellhops and anyone else likely to come \nin contact with foreigners. Beijing, normally about as warm and fuzzy as New York City, sparkled clean, \ngreen and friendly for ten days. And that perception of Beijing became the reality that millions took home \nwith them. \n\n\nCities with infinite human and capital resources are one thing. But what about the perception you \nare creating personally - as an individual and as the representative of your company? For starters, you only \nhave one opportunity to establish a powerful initial perception of yourself. The clich\u00e9 is correct - you don't \nget a second chance to make a first impression. \n\n\nSuppose you had a young person call you for an interview appointment. Fifteen minutes after the \nappointed time, he shows up in jeans and a \u201c\u0412\u0430\u0439 Boy\" T-shirt. His hair should be on his sister's head, he's \ngot an earring, a menagerie of tattoos and an attitude. Now this kid could have just graduated from Harvard \nBusiness School, but you couldn't care less. You've judged him by his appearance, and he's out of there. You \ndon't give a damn that it would have been politically correct for you seriously to consider this bum, just to \nshow what an open-minded guy you are. \n\n\n(As far as I'm concerned, political correctness is an idea made up by psychobabblers to make \nhabitual whiners and full-time victims feel better. But what the hell do I know? I\u2019m just a \u201cmoney-enabled | \nwhite man.\") \n\n\nThe point is, this kid created the instant perception of a goofy, worthless doofus- which was real \nenough for you to believe in! \n\n\nWhen I go to a business meeting, and especially an initial meeting with people I've never met, \nI dress for the occasion. That means a Saville Row tailored suit, maybe with waistcoat vest, hand-tailored \ndress shirt, bold tie, antique gold pocket watch and free-flowing breast pocket handkerchief. The message \nto those people is, I don't look like them because I\u2019m not like them.

It \nwas there, even as a young officer, that I first saw how the European well-to-do dressed, and how they created \nby their actions, even facial expressions, an immediate perception of calm, studied, self-assurance, an aura of \narrogance regardless of how shallow and superficial they might prove to be. \n\n\nCandice Noll remembers. I\u2019ve known Candice since 1983 when I was traveling back and forth \n| between London and Houston. She's a classy lady. Her company, Executive Lodging, was and is an upscale \n\n\nYou bet they were intimidated. In the years that followed, when I'd go see a potential lender, \necially one of those pasty-faced \u201cloan officers\" that makes $35,000 a year, I'd approach his desk like the \nttleship Missouri about to dock. The suit, the attitude, the \u201ceat-your-lunch\u201d eye contact - the poor son-of- \nitch would be asking himself, \u201cWhy does he need to talk about a loan? We should probably be borrowing \nhim.\" (Nowadays, with a multi-million dollar credit line, I send one of my associates over to handle \nfinancing transactions. That suits the bank just fine. They still cringe when they see me walk in.) \n\n\nAlong these lines, a great book I recommend you read is Winning Through Intimidation, written \nRobert J. Ringer. It advocates assuming an assertive posture of strength in doing business in order to gain \nhold the initiative.

Research has long confirmed that powerful people \n| use eye movements to dominate and control a conversation. When they speak, for example, high performers \n| look at others squarely in the eye, but then look away when they listen. An executive who continuously looks \n| another executive in the eye while that person is talking is perceived to be too eager to please and easily \nmanipulated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe personality development books tell you to smile when you go into a new interpersonal situation. \nMake people feel at ease. If I\u2019m walking into the corporate office of an executive with whom I\u2019m negotiating, \nor into the cubicle of some doofus loan officer to talk about money, I don t want the moron feeling at ease. \nMy intent is to create an instant perception of myself as a super successful individual who doesn't need to \nimpress anybody with flattery. I'm not there to be this guy\u2019s friend or especially his whipping boy. I'm going \nto intimidate him in his own ballpark, so that he has to struggle just to stay on the defensive. He has to earn a \nsmile and a pat on the head from Dan \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430, by saying what Dan \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430 wants to hear. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSounds reasonable, doesn't it? \n\n\nBy the way, part of my persona as super successful multimillionaire is my refusal to carry business \ncards. Why not? Do you think Ted Turner carries business cards? Or Donald Trump? The super successful \ndo not distribute business cards. Instead, they say, \"Have your secretary call my office. They know where to \n\n\nreach me.\" \n\n\nYes, first impressions are important. But even more important than the first snapshot of you \nwalking in is the consistency of your impression. After all, the multi-dimensional image you mold in the \nmind of a potential investor, lender or equity partner is only a compilation of several smaller meetings and \ncontacts. Each contact adds another facet to who you are, another quality of your character, personality and \nbusiness style. It's important that as you build this dimensionality you don't create confusing, contradictory \nimages. Every face you show must agree with the overall image you wish to create. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn his bestseller, The 110% Solution, Mark McCormack made an astute observation about putting \nfirst impressions into perspective: \n\u201cThink about the long-term relationships in your life, in or \u043e\u0448 of the workplace. The chances \u2014 \n\n\nare they didn't blossom because someone overwhelmed you the first time you met, but rather because they | \ncontinued influencing you on the second, third and fourth occasions.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nChapter 5 \u2022 Building Perception to Become Reality \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistency of perception is also vital with your own associates and employees. They need to \n\n\n1 | constantly beating their brains out trying to guess what your reaction will be, what mood you\u2019re in or what \n2 executive mask you're wearing today. \n\ns \n\n\u0437 That's not to say you should cultivate the image of \u0430\u043f unemotional, unflappable boss. A little well \ny | placed and justified rage now and again does wonders. But save your table-pounding theatrics for special \n\n\n- occasions, so they'll make a more profound impression. Mark McCormack recommends some occasional \n| unexpected behavior. If your people are expecting you to yell, speak softly but forcefully. If your counterpart \n| across the negotiating table is expecting a certain tactic, change fields and run another pattern. While \n\n\n\u00bb consistency is a virtue, certain predictability is boring as hell. \n\n2. \n\n\u043e As far as corporate perceptions, some moderately successful corporations maintain an image \nE much like the punk kid I described above. At one Florida marketing firm, the boss comes to the office in \n\n\n| a sweat suit, the employees wear jeans or shorts, and the atmosphere is more like a factory floor than an \nexecutive office. All day long the air is filled with chaos \u2014 sophomoric screaming and cursing to the extent \nother business neighbors have come over to complain. What kind of perception does this create for walk-in \nclients expecting professional behavior? Or even suppliers who talk about this company to the competitors? \n\u2018The owner, a perennial wise guy, will never change. And his company will never become super successful. \n\n\n\n\n\n55 \nul Instead of pulling a company down, perception should boost the company up to the plain to which \nleadership aspires. I related in the second chapter how I tied the GW dinghy to the seaworthy reputation \narrion Refining.

As stockholders, the new management people were getting dividends \ntoo. It turned out they cut their own throats. When the dividends ended, the stock plunged into the toilet, and \nthey all lost a lot of money.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my disciples \u2014 we'll call him \u201cWilber\u201d - was an entrepreneurial pilot. He worked out \nof his house near until his business took off, or out of hotel rooms wherever he happened to be laying over \nbetween flights. But he was thinking well beyond his career in the cockpit, continuously interviewing major \naccounting firms, investment bankers and others as he built his \u201cdream team.\u201d And all the while, he was \ncreating the clear perception of an established and knowledgeable businessman. \n\n\nIf you had called Wilber in those early days, he didn\u2019t pick up his home phone and say \u2018Hello,\u2019 \nHis calls were routed through an answering service that acted as his corporate switchboard. \u2018Good morning, \nThe Diversified Company.\u2019 \n\n\nThe caller, once identified, would be put through as if Wilber was back in the executive offices, \nHe even used remote call forwarding so that, if he happened to be laying over in some Holiday Inn, the \nperception was maintained. \u201cHey,\u201d he would tell me, \u201cit costs me about $100 a month, and for all they know | \nThe Diversified Company is a large corporation in an executive tower in downtown Philadelphia.\u201d \n\n\nThe Verdiers work to maintain the perception of their craft shows as prestigious events, admitting \nonly the most qualified exhibitors and sponsors. \u201cJn a few of our markets, our shows have to be staged in \n\n\n\n\n\nfairground arenas. That means we have to work even harder to project that upscale image and to put as \nmuch distance as possible between our expositions and the other flea markets that come along. As our shows \nhave grown in popularity and reputation, we've had to be more and more particular about who we accept \nto sponsor them in each city. As part of maintaining our quality perception, we limit our sponsors to such \nrespectable entities as newspapers, radio stations which appeal to our demographics - no rap, no rock - \n\n\n\n\n\nbanks and soft drink companies.\u201d \n\n\nGeorge Verdier points out those perceptions will only endure for so long. In order to produce \u0430 \nsuccessful and profitable event, he and Deann must build the perception of their show\u2019s quality in a given \nmarket long before the show ever opens. \u201cOnce we open, image gives way to the quality of our performance, \n\n\nand we replace our carefully constructed perception with reality and reputation. If you can t follow through, \u2014 \nall the perception in the world is a house of cards.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00c1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly on in the development of Great Western Resources, it grew increasingly clear that if my \nand I were going anywhere, we both had to look as if we were already there. I knew that our \nss partners, investors and the financial community in general had to see me now as I planned to become \nn the future, or we wouldn't even have a future! I needed a quick transfusion of perception, one so dramatic \n\nit was virtually inarguable. \n\n\nSo, as I mentioned earlier, that's when I decided to buy the castle I could hardly afford. \n\n\nIt was an expensive project, and a huge task, emotionally and logistically, to relocate from a major \nU.S. city to rural Scotland. But it worked. Acquiring a Scottish castle quickly becomes grist for conversation \nnd grudging awe, even in the jaded corridors and conference rooms of Manhattan. As soon as Wall Street \nized I didn't need their help, I got it. It was a case of using reality, the purchase, to create a perception that \n@ s a greater reality. \n\n\nSpeaking of illusion, I decided that in order to accelerate our castle shopping, I had to be perceived \n5 a serious potential buyer. After all, there are those who play \"Let's pretend\u201d with high-end properties for \nsale. They read the classifieds of European publications, then drive out to view this or that castle or chateau \nto gain entry and \u201csee what it\u2019s like.\u201d Real estate people can smell an imposter instantly, and reserve for \nem a special level of disdain. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo for the purpose of putting separation between myself and the proletariat, and to create the \nperception I could even afford a castle, I would hire a chauffeur-driven luxury automobile before every \ning appointment. You can imagine how the appearance of such a spectacle gliding onto the grounds \nd affect the attitude of a real estate representative. I was warmly welcomed and afforded every courtesy, \nse": null, " but more important, I forced the issue of serious negotiations. In this case, 1 used perception to cut \nie chase of purchasing my dream castle. \n\n\nGranted, Guthrie Castle is an extreme example. But what about the perception of success you \n(\u00a9 cultivate in order to be even more successful?

But his social events were elaborate affairs, attended by some \nof the wealthiest men and women in America. \n\n\nThe lesson here is to position yourself where you believe people will perceive you as being \nsuccessful. The Hollywood crowd, of course, has been doing this for generations. \n\n\nThis strategy has benefits beyond the doofus lending officer. When you're perceived to be a success, \nbusiness people want to be associated with you. You become sought out by others with a potential deal. You \nspend less time fishing for opportunities because the fish begin jumping into your net and even your boat. My \nown perception as a dealmaker, of course, became reality. As a result, over the years, I\u2019ve been continuously \ndeluged with plans, schemes and even a few good ideas presented by individuals and corporations looking for \na champion for their venture. They know I\u2019m always looking, and I am a real and serious player! \n\n\n\n\n\nUsing perceptions to create realities is not limited to image-building for up-and-coming companies \nor individuals. It permeates every phase of business operations. A successful company needs to pump up its \nimage at strategic times throughout its corporate life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you're preparing for your initial public offering (IPO), you want brokers and purchasers \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalike to perceive an enormously shrewd, dynamic and aggressive company poised for skyrocketing success. \nYou want editorial column space in The Wall Street Journal, and your top executives to be seen in the most \nexclusive circles exuding acumen, confidence and comfort about taking their company public. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou want stockbrokers and potential buyers talking hungrily about you at lunch, licking their lips \nfor your stock long before the day you go public. Remember - the perception of that stock isn\u2019t based on any \nface value, but on the demand that has been generated for that stock. If you do it right, the result on the day \nof your offering, as it was with us in London that August 10\", will be that of selling shares at spiraling prices \nto eager investors quite willing to pay those prices. \n\n\nFinally, well before the time comes to sell your company, you begin using a number of proven \n\n\n\n\n\nstrategies to build the perception of a successful, profitable corporation. We'll cover those strategies in a later \nchapter. \n\n\nWe live in a world of perceptions. Virtually nothing is really as it seems, only as sleight-of-hand \nmanipulators would have us believe. Don\u2019t forget that others with whom you deal - or would deal -are busy \nbuilding perceptions for your consumption. They range from resumes filled with lies to financial statements \nwith more juggling than Ringling Brothers! \n\n\n& E \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3uick \nsome \n\n\nbeing \n\n\nseess, \n.

These two \nc Itrasting perceptions, nof their stands on major political issues, swayed primary voters to nominate Obama \nperhaps the best known American woman in the world. \n\n\nThat's why, wherever you're called on to believe a perception, it's absolutely vital for you to look \neyond the illusions others would have you take as reality. \n\n\nIn an ideal world, everyone would be forthright and honest in presenting themselves and their \nte entities, \u201cwarts and all\". But until that ideal comes along, perception will be the reality others \nabout you. So it's up to you to craft that reality to your fullest advantage. \n\n\nFortunately, you need not do it alone.

You can\u2019t be in a Los Angeles bank to nail down \nfinancing at noon, and sign a deal in Manhattan at two. The most determined, passionate, vision-driven high \nperformer does not have the expertise, energy or hours in the day to carry out every action, check every figure \nand review every contract generated by a company assuming a growth position. \n\n\nYour company, your entrepreneurial creation, is understandably a source of pride. Nobody else \nloves it, frets over it and perceives your vision for it like you do. Nevertheless, the time comes when you must \ngive up some, in fact a significant portion, of that creation to others in order for it to become what you dream \nfor it. You must relinquish pride of authorship to the hands of others inside and outside your company. \n\n\nPride of authorship has been the death of countless otherwise promising companies because its | \n\"founding father\" wouldn't let it go. Let's follow that parental parallel for a moment. You have a darling \ndaughter you helped bring into the world. Your highest ambition is to nurture that little girl, shape and form \nevery phase of her young life so that she blossoms into an intelligent, happy and successful woman. But you \ncan't do it alone. Along the way you have to entrust her to school teachers, piano teachers, camp counselors \nand drama coaches. With luck you'll achieve your ambition for her, but to do that, you have to share control \nwith other, carefully selected specialists. \n\n\nYour entrepreneurial relationship with your company is much the same. You have to hire and \nretain experts in finance, accounting and tax law to help give your enterprise the direction and counsel you \ncan't give it. You need the skills of stockbrokers, investment bankers, merchant bankers and commercial \nbankers, attorneys, accountants and consultants in several fields whose knowledge you value. Finally the \nday comes when, for the sake of a few million dollars, you sell out piece by piece to legions of profit-driven \nshareholders, strangers who view your entrepreneurial creation not with your passion but with undisguised \ngreed, or at least as a potential source of security for their retirement years. \n\n\nThat's why you use fwo levers to pry open the way to super success - Other People's Money... \n\n\n\n\n\nand Other People.

' Not at all. Directors are your first and most immediate \nent. You wouldn't think of playing a baseball game, and fielding every position with no other players \nyourself until about the fourth inning. So why would you begin your company with yourself being the one \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrd \na\" nd only expert filling every position of responsibility. \nth \n\u0442\u0435 You may think of your enterprise as simple and uncomplicated, but if you're preparing for a Quantum \nto the big leagues, you've got to fill all the positions on the field now/ Before the game starts. So \nrporate, if you haven't already, retain the titles of President and Chief Executive Officer, and begin your \n$e for your Dream Team directors. \nst \ndi The most immediate benefits your board of directors bring to your Dream Team are credibility and \nige. The best source of directors is recently retired CEOs and other top executives of local, regional and \nen national companies. And they're not inaccessible. As with finding a suitable mentor, pick up the phone and \ns Explain your situation and the direction in which you're moving, and how you have some fantastic ideas on \n\" lidating a cottage industry or whatever your goal may be.

Your \nboard ideally should include a financial person, an accounting specialist, and one or two other individuals who \nhave already achieved what you're trying to achieve in your field of endeavor, particularly in growing a company \ngeometrically through acquisition. Your accounting expert might be a former regional managing partner of a Big \nFour accounting firm.

They are the core from which you will now proceed to build an \n\n\naggressive, acquisition-hungry corporation. \n\n\nBy the way, your board must be what I call *lawsuit-aware\". Although it may go without saying, at \nsome point mention it to them anyway for the record: you accept litigation as a part of exponential growth, You \nregard litigation as a legitimate business tool (and if you don\u2019t you should). If the idea of filing suit makes you \nuneasy, and the thought of getting sued frightens you away from acting in the best interests of your company, \nstop reading here and go get a good romance novel. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn business as in life, disagreement happens. Assassins abound. Trust me - I\u2019ve been involved in \nabout 200 lawsuits and have only lost a couple of times in the U.S. or the U.K. The greed, arrogance and the \nstupidity of others need to be kicked out of your path to glory without a second thought, without a break in \nstride, Be mentally prepared to do battle in court whenever you have to - and have a board of directors prepared | \n\n\nto back you up. \n\n\nAs for compensation, don\u2019t even bring it up the first or second time you and your prospective | \ndirectors talk. Whatever you may offer is table scraps compared to the wealth they\u2019ve accumulated after 30 \nyears of business leadership. Eventually, almost as an afterthought, mention you'd like to offer each director \n2% to 5% of your company, depending on the extent of their time and participation involved.

Do \nnot confine yourself to a time frame - that\u2019s a detail at this point. \n\n\nWhile you and your directors fine-tune your Mission Statement, also pull together executive \nprofiles of your directors. When all the documents are complete and professionally bound as a presentation \n\u0434\u043e\u0448, begin setting up interviews with accounting firms. Your new directors will no doubt have contacts \nimong the Big Four. Use those entrees. If not, pick the phone and start making cold calls on accounting \n\n\ntain ng the Right Professionals - For the Right Price \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of accounting firms? For starters, you need the expertise of a highly reputable CPA \nn \u2014 or Chartered Accountant firm in \u045b\u0435 U.K. My contention has always been that you avoid hiring your \n\u0411\u043e\u0433 or your cousin the accountant, or even the hometown CPA company. From the very beginning, \nBig Four accounting firm. How can you afford the best? \u2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche \nu, Ernst & Young or KPMG? We'll get to that later. (By the way, each of these firms is actually an \n\u0437 group of companies operating globally, with between 120,000 and 150,000 employees and annual \nS of around 25 billion dollars. \n\n\n\n\n\nSet up preliminary interviews with all the Big Four accounting firms with offices in the city in \n'ou'll be doing business. If you are not close to a Big Four firm, you will have to consider a firm in \n\n\nits meet you outside their office. If your new offices don't have a conference room, try to arrange \nhere. If you must meet at the accounting firm, make note of the size of the conference room they \nas well as the seniority of the accountants you're meeting with. It'll indicate their initial estimate \nntial as a profitable client. Make sure that a partner is present. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzd Many successful individual started by interviewing regional accounting firms and then moving on \nto the Big Four when their comfort level increased. I strongly recommend this practice. \n\n\nThe first meeting is a brief one. Your presentation should last about 20 minutes, during which \nyou simply expand and elaborate on your mission statement, re-emphasizing the fact that you intend to \nconsolidate through acquisition an industry that is fragmented and basically in chaos. You also tell them up \nfront you're interviewing four other accounting firms, and you'll go with the one which offers your company \nthe best deal. The whole meeting should last no more than 40 to 45 minutes. It's a beauty contest! \n\n\nDuring the second round of interview meetings, you may have narrowed the field to maybe two \nor three firms. You should expect these interviews to be attended by an audit partner and/or a tax partner, plus \n\n\nsomeone who has experience in corporate finance. \n\n\nWhen you're obviously an aggressive company seeking growth through acquisitions, accounting \nfirms will listen to you for two reasons. First, they envision their own geometric billings growth riding on top \nof yours. Second, a company in an acquisition mode is less likely to change accountants once their accounting \nfirm picks up the rhythm of the company and understands its vision, pace and tempo. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives you the opportunity to leverage your potential with regard to their fees. Accountants \nwill work on a contingency fee basis (except for auditing), with fees linked to success or failure. \"Audit \nindependence\" is important to accounting firms, as defined for them in the Generally Accepted Accounting \nProcedures (GAAP). Nearly all countries have similar rules and procedures. \n\n\nSo you talk to accountants about \u201cvalue-added fees\" and \u201csuccess-oriented fees.\" Underline \nthese terms! They are very important phrases for you to use. Recently I made presentations to a number of \naccounting firms, and in every instance, the partners immediately responded to those terms. \n\n\nOne Big Four partner suggested they will bill only 50% of their hourly rate until we made \u00e0 \nsuccessful acquisition": null, " then 100% and then play catch-up until they made their 50% balance. Another Big \nFour firm said they would wait for six months after our first transaction to begin full billing. The point is that \naccountants are flexible as long as the aura of professional \u201cindependence\u201d is respected. \n\n\nAt each of your second meetings, accounting partners will be selling to you. You should ex] \nthem to respond to your previous presentation, and be prepared to discuss your specific needs and expectations \nof them as a Big Four firm. \n\n\nBy the third meeting, you should have the input and intuition to have narrowed your choices t0 \ngre or two firms.

At any rate, when our lawyers spoke, with advice or \n\n\ninion, people listened. \n\n\nHave I mentioned perception/reality lately? At the outset, our choice of law firms enhanced the \neption that we were more successful than we were - but certainly as successful as we intended to be. \nicidentally, one of our lawyers at Freshfields was a cocky Australian named Allen Murray Jones - smart, yet \nnverted to become our mole at Freshfields. Even with the amount of business we ran through Freshfields, \n\u0435 never did make partner. After centuries of tradition, Freshfields just couldn't be swayed by enormous \ngs of an upstart American oil company. When Jones left to join another large international law firm, \nnt Piese (now part of a much larger firm), we followed him, and the leverage of our business helped him \nine come a partner there.) \n\n\nits \ndit \nng \n\n\n\n\n\nHere's another tip for assembling your Dream Team. Whenever possible, within the oak-paneled \nof any attorneys or CPAs, I've always sought out a hungry young lawyer or accountant I could trust, \nnd-comer with greater ambitions and more talent than his employer appreciated. I cultivate such \nmotivated individuals, because inevitably they become my moles within their own organization. Their \nice gradually shifts from their employer to me, to that instead of telling me what I cannot do, they find \nof enabling me to do what I want to do! Now, in no way are they doing something wrong. But they are \nW looking at and digesting information in a much different light. You are no longer merely a client. You're \nent. \n\n\u0410 caution: be kind to your mole. In my younger, less sensitive days, I often screamed unkind \n\u20ac to our mole at Coopers & Lybrand (now PricewaterhouseCoopers). She served us well enough for \nwhen I left Great Western, she found ways to repay my verbal indiscretions, although I have to say \nalways a first-class professional. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n5 What's in it fora hotshot lawyer or accountant? I continuously remind their employer how valuable \nthey are, and how worthy they are of raises and promotions. But dearer to everyone's heart, given the right \nindividual and the right circumstances, I can offer them equity in the entrepreneurial success they're helping \nme create. When that occurs, of course, you'll find that they almost always leave their firm to join you full- \ntime. \n\n\nThat brings us back to your venture. During the early stages of your pursuit, when you're just \nbuilding your Dream Team, how can you afford to retain a top law firm? You bring them into the equation. \n\n\n\u201cC'mon, Dan, you can t do that. You can t walk in and buy them with a piece of action that doesnt \nexist. \" I sure as hell did. I also secured the services of blue chip brokerage firms in the same way. More than \n\n\n\n\n\nonce. \n\n\nTop legal counsel costs, say, $450 to $850 an hour or more. I mean the clock starts when your \nlawyer picks up the phone. It costs you a quarter to say good morning. But lawyers are not as concerned with \n\"independence\" as their counterparts in accounting. Regardless of what they'd have you think, lawyers are \npeople with needs and greed just like you. And they'll listen to a deal. | \n\n\nHere's how. \u201cYou say you're good, counselor? You say you can make this deal happen. I believe | \n\u0443\u043e\u0438 can. So here's my deal. Your fee is $475 an hour? I'll pay you $550 or even $600 an hour when we're | \nsuccessful... or $100, maybe $200 an hour if it crashes. ' (The lower figure is meant to cover their real costs, \nsuch as paralegal and administrative expenses.) But any fee must come out of a successful transaction, and \nfees for unsuccessful deals are rolled into the next transaction. \n\n\nMy rationale is that \u0430\u043b\u0443 fee for a deal is too high if it crashes. But almost \u043b\u043e fee is too high if we \nscore. Hey, if we make $10 - $20 million, I\u2019m delighted to share the wealth with the lawyer who worked: \nnights for six weeks, who found loopholes that would choke a gnat, who worked for me rather than the IRS \nor the SEC. Accountants, of course, are bound by certain restrictions that preclude them from taking direct \nequity positions and direct contingency fees, but they will work with you on non-audit issues. Believe me": null, " \nthey will cooperate. In some of their most recent deals, my partners in several growth companies have fount \nprofessionals quite willing to defer fees altogether for six months. \n\n\nAlong the way, that lawyer will perform feats of acrobatic prowess even he never believed possibl \nWhy? Because instead of getting a flat fee regardless of outcome, he\u2019s got equity in success. And believe mi \nsince adopting a \"success : success\" strategy, I've never had a professional advisor kill a deal.

They know that Ernst & Young \nPricewaterhousCoopers won't accept a client without doing thorough due diligence. With the light of \nwerhouses such as these behind you, you cast a hell of a shadow in the offices of any banking institution! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntners and Staff \n\n\nAs your enterprise gathers momentum, the next person you're likely to seek out is a partner, a co- \nnt for your venture. This should be an individual whose skills, talents and temperament complement your \nand fill critical gaps in your own range of strengths. After all, you don't want another you. You want \nebody you're not, in as many areas as possible. \n\n\nMark McCormack, writing in The 110% Solution, pointed out that individuals perform beyond \niormal capacities when they are teamed with a partner who is better than they are. In sports competition, \n\n\nuite often see a tennis player or a golfer stretch their potential to keep pace with a higher ranked player. \n\n\nMcCormack believed that choosing a superior partner is an instinct we have in childhood. The \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u203a become aware that our own performance is being judged and compared against others. \u201cSelf-interest \nus seek weaker partners who make us look stronger by comparison,\u201d McCormack wrote, rather than \nig kid\" who can help elevate our performance.

It takes guts to do it right. The temptation \nfor a lot of entrepreneurs is to hire individuals who can be controlled, so that their own pride of authorship can \nbe sustained. That's insane. Why would they bring in some doofus with less imagination, less initiative and \ndimmer vision, and think for a minute he'd help them propel their vision forward? Instead of adding powerful \nengines to their venture, these entrepreneurs are only adding ballast. \n\n\nOne of the most obvious qualifications is experience. Read the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. And read between the \nlines. Has this guy spent his career as an executive clerk for some top corporations that read terrific on his \nr\u00e9sum\u00e9? Or has he done deals? Can you see from a couple of sheets of paper that here's a corporate squad \nleader who has wrestled through the hell of negotiations and actually won? \n\n\nThink of your staff as an elite fighting team. And to be elite, they must have fought. \n\n\nThere are other considerations as well. I seek out potential associates and partners with enormous \ntalent, who have strengths I do not, whose energy and vision match my own, and who nurture enormous | \negos! In short, I'm looking for people who want my job! But good help is hard to find... and bad help is \nabundant! \n\n\nI also hire people more on attitude than credentials. You can't browbeat them into enthusiasm. You \ncan't pump them up if they were born deflated and have never been pumped up. They have to bring a good \nsolid \"can do\" attitude with them, so you can harness it to help pull your dream. \n\n\nHire people with an appetite for adventure too. Because that\u2019s what they're about to have if thi \nsign up to join your high wire quest for super success. When you begin looking for associates and staff \npersonnel, you talk to a lot of qualified, certified people who prefer the serenity and predictability of the status \nquo. They value their safety and security, and lead neatly patterned lives. And they're boring as hell. In my \nmind they're already dead, lying around waiting for the undertaker. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for every 15 to 20 of these losers, you discover one man or woman, one uncut jewel \nsalivates at the prospect of helping you explore and conquer new territory. You're the chance they've \nwaiting for! And you can bet they'll forsake everything for a chance to join your adventure! \n\n\nAnother key factor to be considered in bringing-in associates is personality. Like the weathef \nwe can't change personality but we can talk about it. Growing an idea into a marketable company requir\u00eb \nenormous mental and physical energy, and a focused commitment of personal time and resources \nyou cannot allow to be sidetracked by conflicting personalities. Your key personnel simply must have d \ninterpersonal chemistry to get along. If not, their ego and personal agendas will divert the energies you nc \nof them toward widening the chasm between them. And your Dream Team will give you nightmares! \n\n\nLa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, beware of staffing your organization with people just because you like them or \n": null, " get along with one another. You're not putting together a social club, and a team of dim bulbs, no matter \ncompatible and congenial, will never accomplish anything. \n\n\nI want to hire people who can surprise me. Nothing pleases a high performer more than for an \n\u043e\u0443\u0435\u0435 or partner to have an idea first. Remember - the high performer values the idea, the inspiration, the \nution far more than pride of authorship. Personally, I\u2019m delighted whenever one of my partners surprises \nith a spark of genius. It confirms what a perceptive guy I was to bring him or her onto the team. And it \ns me I\u2019m getting more then my money's worth. (By the way, I use the term \u201cpartners\u201d because all my staff \n\nequity of some sort.) \n\n\nFinally, I look for commitment. I don\u2019t mean 9-to-5. My people must be willing to work nights, \nends, holidays or whenever necessary during critical periods of growth. They must be instantly available \nhome, on the golf course or in any airport in the world. They need to fly to New York today. They need to \n\u0435 the proposal tonight, hammer out a deal tomorrow morning and meet me in Houston tomorrow night. \nt want to hear about Junior's softball game or a house full of company or any other personal bullshit. I \n\n\nlule meetings on early Sunday mornings or Saturday nights. I find out when they have birthdays or \nies, so I can set up meetings that screw up party plans. Okay, I'm a son-of-a-bitch, but the Doofus \n'es me two essential pieces of information about people: first, how they react under emotional pressure, \nond, how committed they are to me and my agenda. Sure, it\u2019s fine if they've promised to take their kid \ngame and can\u2019t change their plans. But they can't work for Dan Pefia. Otherwise, down the line, \nght have the birth of their first child take precedence over all of us making millions of dollars! \n\n\nHaving talked in abstracts about personalities and commitment, it's time you heard about two \nwho, years after the fact, still personify total commitment in my mind. In August of 1994, I was \nboard meeting of my holding company, Great Western Development Corporation, at Guthrie Castle, \nThe meeting was set to begin August 17^, and it was expected to be a two or three-day meeting. \nparticipants was a young man in his late twenties. We'll call him Jon. I had brought him on the \nly on the recommendation of his older brother, Adam, who already worked with me. Neither of \nS yet 30 years old. \n\n\nUnknown to me, Jon had confided to one of my assistants that he was a little anxious about \nthree day\" meeting in Scotland, because he was getting married on August 20\". But he never \nlit to me. Not a word! He and Adam flew to Scotland and gave a great presentation. And still no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng \none told me about the imminent wedding, Jon\u2019s desire for success enabled him to risk getting home the day of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhis wedding, and he never wavered. He never asked \u201cwhat if?\u201d Instead, he committed, knowing he might be \nracing from the airport to the wedding aisle, dressing in the car, and missing all the social rituals that precede \nany formal wedding. Not a very auspicious beginning for a marriage, he surely must have thought. \n\n\nAs it turned out, Jon arrived a full 24 hours before the presentation. No problem, right? \n\n\nBut let me ask you - what would you have done? Would you have demanded such commitment? \nAnd would you have given such commitment? Had I known, I would not have excused Jon from the meeting. \nI would have left the choice up to him, as indeed it was anyway. The mark of a high performer is that he both \ndemands and delivers total commitment to the business. I\u2019ve never asked any of my team to do something \nThaven\u2019t done. In fact, I still do whatever it takes, no matter what. \n\n\nAnd let's talk about the older brother, Adam. I was holding a Quantum Leap seminar in May, \n1995, in Los Angeles, and was expecting about 800 attendees. (I had met him at a previous Jim Newman \nPACE Seminar, and he became a member of my team in late 1994. In fact, nowadays, I find most of my future | \nbusiness partners during my own seminars.) I asked the two brothers to be there, since we could use any spare \ntime to talk business. What I didn't know was that Adam's wife was expecting their second child that same \nweek. Adam didn't hesitate, and never mentioned the impending baby. He arrived for the seminar and stayed \nthrough the weekend, helping with the seminar and discussing business issues. \n\n\nAgain, what does conventional wisdom say? And what would most people have done? But the. \nlarger question is, what do these two brothers possess that generates such a high level of commitment? Ho! \nare they different? They both had twelve years of Catholic school education, played college soccer at Te: \nChristian University, joined a fraternity, graduated and married. Adam has an MBA, although I've nev \nheld it against him. Then they both left promising positions with large corporations, and took enormous \u0440\u0430) \n\n\nreductions to join my team. \n\n\nI gave them each equity in one of my companies at a time when the company was little more \n\u0430 dream of mine, with the growing potential to be worth tens of millions of dollars over the next few y: \nWe'll talk later about giving equity to achieve your Quantum growth. \n\n\nOnce before in my career, I had two partners who were as close to the ideal as I can ever hi \nfor. They shared my fervor for success, and were driven by their own dreams to commit their lives to \nWestern. In fact, one arguably gave his life in pursuit of Quantum growth. \n\n\nMark Harrison was a lawyer who specialized in oil and gas matters and corporate law. I met \n\n\n\n\n\nwhile I was still with JPK Industries, and he was handling our legal affairs for a nationally known law \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nChapter 6 * Creating Your Dream Team \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwas a young, energetic partner. Because of his brilliance, I sought to cultivate him initially as a mole, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark started out with Great Western Development Corporation in 1983 on a part-time basis. I \ngave him a verbal deal for one year, and his law firm gave him a year to decide whether he wanted to cast his \nlot with Dan \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430 and GWDC. \n\n\nMark became my Chief Operating Officer at Great Western, and was given 10% ownership in \nhe company. By virtue of his legal background, he had the skills to visualize and nitpick every aspect of an \nsue, every phrase in a contract. I never once heard him say, \u2018Hmm, I didn't cover that... I'll have to get back \n\n\n> \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we came to London, guns blazing for Great Western, Mark\u2019s equity paid off handsomely \nAugust day we went public. At that precious point in time, the three of us- Mark, Charlie and I - were \nible. We were Wyatt, Virgil Earp and Doc Holiday at the OK Corral, just like in the movies where they \ner ran out of bullets and take no prisoners. We acted day after day as if we had no limits to our abilities. \n\n\nIn the coming years, differences of management style and opinion would remove Mark from \nional authority at Great Western, and in 1991, he was terminated with a seven-figure goodbye handshake \n\n\nI met Charlie Soladay when he was part of an acquisition team we formed in the late Seventies. \nt time he was a partner with Coopers & Lybrand in the Fort Worth office. He was an audit partner. He \n\u04af health care best, but had a good base in oil and gas. I was immediately impressed by Charlie's highly \nense of ethics. He knew right from wrong and acted accordingly. In a business world which normally \n\u043f \u201csituational ethics,\" Charlie was a refreshing change of pace. I eventually weaned Charlie away \nbig-company comfort of his firm, took away his safety net, made him my Chief Financial Officer - \nn again businessman! He was a natural \u201cworkaholic,\u201d and as one energy company CEO put it, \u201cwore \nout from the inside\". \n\n\nCharlie was a fine, totally competent CFO. But more important to me was the fact that he was \none who could use his talents and technical skills to make his dreams become realities. He was \n\"people person,\" and the best *numbers man\" I ever saw. But his value to me and GW lay in his \nSought his counsel. I trusted his judgment and his loyalty. I knew without a doubt that in the heat \nte battle, Charlie would follow my lead and cover my back no matter what.

So many times, we would analyze, evaluate, plan our strategies far into \nthe night. Then he would sleep at my place (sharing a couch with my two great danes), fly off into the early \nmorning to another meeting across the continent, and see his family whenever he could. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the time we decided to take GW public in March, 1984, through two major acquisitions and \nseveral smaller ones by the end of 1986, Charlie, Mark and I blazed like a comet across the financial skies. The \nsecond acquisition was that of a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign multi-billion dollar natural resources company, \nand involved coal mines and gas and oil properties across the country. It was a long, tough negotiation I'll get \ninto later, but by the time the deal was closed in December, 1986, we were all exhausted. \n\n\nOur ship had come in - and it was loaded with money for all three of us. Jackpot! All the dreams, \nthe work, the pressure, the doing without a \u201cnormal life\u201d with family, friends and sleep had paid off. My | \nDream Team had come through for me. We were wealthy beyond the dreams of most mortals... invincible! I \nwent home to Guthrie Castle, my own Camelot, to heal wounds and savor our victory. We were, as the Roman \nlegions, \u201cInvextus\u201d We were not conquered! \n\n\nThe next month, Charlie Soladay died of a heart attack at 40. Just inside the threshold of his \ngreatest super success, it was over. John Lennon said, \u2018Life is what happens while you're making plans.\u2019 \n\n\nDan Pe\u00f1a says, \u201cMan plans...and God laughs.\" \u041c\u0443 life was changed forever. It took almost \nthree years to recover from an acquisition eight to ten times our size... and Charlie's death. \n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter who you recruit for your Dream Team, and how gifted and committed they are, they\u2019re \ngoing to need leadership. Even more to the point, they\u2019re going to want leadership. And you\u2019re the leader. It\u2019s \nno wonder reports say that almost 70% of the Fortune 500 CEOs have military backgrounds. \n\n\nThe toughest thing about being a leader is that you're always alone in the lead position. Leadership \nis a towering peak with standing room for one. Sure, you can turn and get advice from this or that team \nmember, but there's only one captain, one driver, one pilot in the cockpit. You. You can save your company \nfrom mistakes the others may make, but the others can't save the company from you! The guy who said \u201cIt\u2019s \nlonely at the top\" had surely been there. I often tell my business partners they must learn to be alone without | \nbeing lonely. | \n\n\nYou're only a leader if you have followers. You can buy quasi-loyalty with money - and we'll | \ntalk about compensation shortly - but you can't make people follow you. They have to want to. Another \nmisconception about leadership is that too many entrepreneurs think of leadership as a static condition. They | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\nsaapa i Rom Re Nes S ii \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nposition of leadership and assume that, by definition, they're leading. Any CEO who is not moving \nher company forward is not leading. The word \"leadership\" implies action. Leading is convincing \nto move, to follow you as you proceed forward in a predetermined direction. If you're not moving, or \nju seem to be moving erratically as if you've lost your way, your associates and employees immediately \n\ne they've lost their leadership, and begin to lead themselves in whatever direction they like. And I can \n\u0448\u0433\u0435 you it won't be in the right direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld history has proven time after time - people much prefer to follow a madman with a clearly \npurpose than a nice guy with no apparent goals. And high performance people are often perceived \nmen. Conventional business people consider them to be loose cannons, eccentrics, even buffoons. \nimes the most loyal employees, stretched on the bone-breaking rack of demands beyond all known \nities, are exasperated by working for high performer. But they don't quit. Great entrepreneurial madmen \nde Richard Branson, Ted Turner, Donald Trump and Rupert Murdock. Howard Hughes was a madman \nong before he went crazy. \n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most demanding high performers was Thomas Edison. In 1884 he hired a young \nian engineer, Nikola Tesla, to work in his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Edison was convinced \n\ndirect electric current (DC) was the way to light the world. Tesla believed that alternating current (AC) \nould be more practical. Already a world-famous inventor, the supremely self-confident Edison had little \nce with employees and disagreed with him, and fired Tesla. In 1889 Tesla patented an AC power \nem, and sold it to George Westinghouse who built an empire generating AC electricity. \n\n\nAs you work with your Dream Team toward achieving your super success, it's fine to be regarded \na little mad by the world beyond. Your perceived madness in the minds of conventional thinkers is a sure \nyou're on the right track. I'd be disappointed if some investment bankers I know didn t shake their heads \nthey talked about Dan Pe\u00f1a. I relish my reputation. But remember Edison. Give your employees the \nde they need to be creative on your behalf. Exponential creativity and imagination by your people will \nerate your achievement of exponential and Quantum growth. In fact, you can't achieve it without it! \n\n\nOne of the great lessons I learned form Jim Newman was to keep my eyes focused on the macro \nire, and leave micro-management to my staff. The Dream Team you assemble has to be capable of that \nto-day micro-management, so that you can press ahead with your job, your responsibilities as both leader \n\nlayer on your own team. Don\u2019t bring mea problem so we can solve it. Solve it yourself and brief me \n\n\nAs the CEO or president of your company, your job is not to design a better product, or reduce \ng costs, or review sales figures. You have engineers, cost accountants and marketing executives to \nthose tasks. Your greatest danger is getting bogged down in the office, and mired by the minutia. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u0411 \n\n\n\n\n\n": "(79) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nie You have three jobs - and they\u2019re all outside the office. The first one is... kissing frogs. \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"E \n\n\n\n\n\nYou've got to kiss a lot of frogs to find a prince. I tell my audiences you do not only have to kiss \nthose frogs, you've got to /ove to do it... and just /ove those little pus-filled warts on those frogs' faces. (Okay, \nI know only toads have warts, but it's \u0442\u0443 story.) Because one day, one of those little frogs, at a bank, at a \nbrokerage firm or in a state legislature, is going to be able to help you, to croak you a good word, to give you \na nod, to become the prince-in-need to make you millions. So get out there, smile ...and start kissing frogs! \n\n\nYour second job as senior executive is to look for expansion opportunities. I'm talking about deals \n- or \"schemes\" as they say in the U.K. That's how you make the big money - equity on deals. And you won't \nfind hot deals in your own shop. So get out into the market, go to trade shows, overhear conversations, talk \nto your moles, keep your ear to the earth of the financial world. And remember - unless you're Kobe Bryant \nor Madonna you won't get rich from income! You become wealthy from equity in a string of transactions. \nPay attention to your industry. Watching business is like standing by a river - every time you look, the water \nis different. Keep watching. Check out rumors and ask questions. If you run a mid-sized business right \nnow, chances are good there's another mid-sized business you could buy tomorrow with OPM - and make a \nQuantum Leap. Then another Quantum Leap. Quantum Leaps are repeatable! Threepeatable! And more! \n\n\nYour third job is finding Other People\u2019s Money - OPM. In Chapter 9, I talk about raising capital, \nfinding the OPM you need to seize opportunities and take decisive action. My God, there are so many sources \nof capital out there it should be embarrassing for anyone to say, \u201cWe don't have the money right now.\u201d As \nyou'll find out, it\u2019s only because you haven't looked. \n\n\nSome of the plumpest, tastiest frogs you ever lay a lip on are sitting in financial institutions all \nover the country, just waiting to lend you money and make themselves look good to their bosses. Help them \nout! As I write this, the economy is heading toward recession. The banking industry is more cautious than \nit has been in many years. Institutions from AIG to Washington Mutual have disappeared from the banking \nlandscape. But regardless of the economy, whether it\u2019s in the clouds or the toilet, bankers make their money \nlending money. A nervous frog is still a frog. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo... while you're out looking for frogs, deals and money, who's running your show? Other \nPeople. Your carefully hand-picked Dream Team. And hopefully, with a free hand from you - and with their \nowning a part of it themselves. (More on that later.) | \n\n\nI discovered long ago that less control, not more control, is the key to effective management. You \nhire people you trust, empower them, and then trust them to perform. If they can't, and you can't trust them, \nfind people you can. It's not the end of the world if you brought someone in, gave him 5% or 10%, and then \nhad to get rid of him. \"But Dan,\u201d you say, \"now he has a piece of my dream. \u201d Calm down.

They'll arrive early, work late, \ncome in Saturdays - whatever it takes to get the job done because they're getting good money and they \n_ know it. \n\n\nYou start by paying them the best salaries in the market. Employees continuously compare their \nlaries with friends at other companies, and you want your employees to win every time. Give Christmas \nbonuses, new account bonuses, birthday bonuses - whatever you can to assure your people they've got a sweet \nb worth working hard to keep. Some bosses periodically hand out unexpected \u201cAppreciation Bonuses,\" \njlling from desk to desk with checks. I personally tie compensation to deals and profitability - plus, you'll \necall, all my people are equity partners. \n\n\nAt Great Western, my people knew that paychecks were tied to income so they all continuously \n\n\n\n\n\nI've previously referred to an extraordinary Brit named Peter Sage. Peter was a spectacular \ner long before we met, owning four companies by the time he was 20 years old. Today he's a globally \n\u00a2 entrepreneur, highly sought motivational speaker and high-end real estate investor. \n\n\nA few years ago, he decided to reward his staff of 22 \u2014 and his mother \u2014 with a Christmas party. \nit enough. Oh, by the way, the party was to be held at the seven-star Berj al Arab, the most elegant, \nexpensive hotel in Dubai. For four breathtaking days, Peter's Mum and everyone in his company - \nist, sales staff, bookkeepers \u2014 lived in the extravagance of the super rich. Opulent two-level suites, \n\nbutler, 42-inch plasma TV screens, panoramas of the Arabian Gulf. Uncommon loyalty was loyalty \nmmonly rewarded. \n\n\nUnfortunately, money is used in some companies as a substitute for respect. It amazes me how \nh crap employees will take for the right money. From the mail clerk to the Executive Vice President \nI know a guy who runs a company of about 35 employees. He calls his women \u201csluts\u201d and his men \n\u201d even in front of clients. He abuses and yells at them continuously, blames them for his screw- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 \u041c\u0438\u043f\u043e\u043f \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[P ups, and buries them with more last minute work with no instructions and tighter deadlines than they could\" \npossibly handle. During one crisis, with his office in chaos, he took off with his pals and went boating. \n\n\nBut no one quits. Ask them why. \"Well, he pays us good money...\u201d \u201c I'd quit, but nobody in town \nwould pay me what he does...\u201d \u201cFor the money I get, he can call me whatever he wants... \u2122 \n\n\nOf course I\u2019m not advocating that kind of treatment for any employee. In fact, I did just the \nopposite. I paid them well and treated them with respect. But the point is that employees place three things \nat the top of their priority list: money, money and money. Above pleasant working conditions, above benefit \npackages, above health club memberships. Employees don't want to be your extended family, even in the 21\" \ncentury. They want to get paid as much as they can haul down the elevator in a wheelbarrow. And when you \nadd respect and recognition, the results are tremendous. Then you've got their loyalty forever. As Napoleon \nHill said in his classic, Think and Grow Rich, after some 20 years of interviewing the 500 richest men in the \nworld, \"The financial motive must prevail\" above all. It was true 80 or 90 years ago, and it's true now. \n\n\n\n\n\n2) Never reprimand. This is pretty elementary stuff, but most employers forget it in the heat of \ncrisis. The clich\u00e9 is, \u201cCriticize in private", " praise in public,\" but, occasional well-placed rage notwithstanding, \nI try not to even criticize my people in private. (\u201cSure, Dan,\" I can hear them now.) Instead, after I\u2019ve \ncooled down enough so I won't rip their heads off, I invite them in, close the door, and in my gentlest \nfatherly voice ask them questions about their mistake that almost cost me my castle. \n\n\n\"What was your reasoning behind taking this action? ' \n\"What happened as a result of that action that was not in our best interests? ' \n\u2018What action would you take next time, given the same circumstances?\u2019 \n\n\n\u201cNext time\u201d is the operative phrase. \u201cNext time\u201d tells them you respect their basic judgment and \nintelligence enough for there to be a next time... this time! \n\n\nSince my company doesn\u2019t normally employ absolute morons, I make the reasonable assumption \nthat a) this person has redeemable qualities that make him or her worthy of continued life and employment": null, " \nand b) he or she is intelligent enough to learn from the fiasco they\u2019ve just caused by screwing up royally. \n\n\nBut more importantly, if employees know they'll be reprimanded for mistakes, and especial, \nhumiliated, they'll never venture out where they can make mistakes. They will never get out of their own bo: \nThey'll never expand their comfort zone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\u0432 ) \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nnuper \u043e ~ Creanng 10ur ream ieam \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Gates pays bonuses for making mistakes. It's true. Gates does this to encourage creativity \nid imagination. He knows good people will make honest mistakes, and he doesn't want them to become \n\n\nBesides, I\u2019ve found that one of the biggest reasons for employee mistakes is lack of information. \nimployees don't make decisions the same way as the CEO because they don't have the same information. \n\n\nThe days of the closed executive office doors are past. Corporate paternalism is dead, killed by \n-mail and the ease of information flow up and down the hierarchy. \n\n\nWe no longer judge the discretion of an executive, even the CEO, by how much information he or \n\u043b\u0435 can keep from the rest of the company. Today we live and work in the Information Age, with staff who \nthe sophistication to receive and process information about their company, and act intelligently based on \ninput. The smart CEO uses that ability to \u201cde-control\u201d his organization, to let responsibility trickle down \nmpetent people eager to accept that responsibility. \n\n\n\n\n\n3) Train one or more employees for your job. Or your jobs, which are to kiss frogs, find deals \nnd raise capital. You want to train others to do what you do, so together you can get to more frogs, ferret \nut more potential deals and get in from of more lenders. It is essential that you bring your people into a \nse of ownership by doing what the CEO or owner is doing. They'll work harder, longer and with more \nitment when you allow them to help steer the future of the company, and not just its present. \n\n\n4) Never make decisions for your employees. Once you give them the information they need, \nlow them to make their own decisions. At the same time, give them the responsibility and authority to \nimplement their own actions. Give them chances to make mistakes from which they can learn. \n\n\nYour employees must grow as your company grows. It is far preferable to have the same number \niastic, capable employees handling more jobs than it is to hire, say, seven more people to handle \nnew tasks. \n\n\nHow you present new challenges will determine how quickly they learn. You can tell them how \njob, and they'll forget. You can show them how to do it, and they may still forget. But if you involve \nprocess, they'll understand, remember and grow. \n\n\nOne interesting example of how employees grow to fulfill the expectations you have of them \ning limits. When I increased the spending authority of mid-level managers, spending actually \nThey began to consider every expenditure as a personal one, and monitored costs more closely and \nientiously than ever. And when I removed limits totally, the expenses went down even more. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAN \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong those same lines, I\u2019ve also found from my own experience that you want every employee \nto think of themselves as an independent contractor. Virtually every job can be \u201cbusinessed,\u201d or turned into \na business run by an employee. A floor supervisor at the Ritz-Carlton can easily think of himself or herself \nas the \u201cCEO of the Fourth Floor.\u201d With that kind of attitude, capable people work smarter and with more \npride. Look at the Saturn story. Every auto worker at the Saturn plant thinks like a CEO of some area of sub- \nassembly. There is no better example of empowerment at work in American industry. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it's Time to Say Goodbye... \n\n\nRegardless of the health and vibrancy of a relationship with a partner or associate, conditions, \ncircumstance and requirements change. Personalities change. And although you and your partners or senior \nexecutives may stay together for a lifetime, the time may come when you need to get rid of somebody, \neven someone you've been through hell with. An incident or a pattern of behaviors confirms that it's in the \ncompany's best interest to terminate someone who helped accelerate your super success. \n\n\nGetting rid of people is one of the hardest jobs for a senior manager or executive. Call it early \nretirement, work furlough, \u201cdownsizing\u201d or \u201crightsizing\u201d - it's no fun for anyone. \n\n\nAnd don't think it\u2019s any easier just because you don't like someone personally. If they're good \ntechnically, if they're super competent, if they can work magic with numbers or negotiations, they're going \nto be hard to replace. \n\n\nOn the other hand, don't delay the inevitable. \n\n\nHarvey Mackay was right in Swim with the Sharks when he said \u2018It isn't the people you fire who \nmake your life miserable, its the people you don tt.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nThe individual who needs to be fired, is almost begging to be fired, but is still around, often \nperforms counter-productively just to see how much you'll take. However unpleasant the act of firing may \nbe, as long as you put it off, you expend energy in a continuous test of wills. An about-to-be-fired employee \nis like a corpse lying in the hallway. Somehow, everyone in the office knows when one of their associates \nhas become superfluous, and tiptoes around the cadaver. And the longer that body lies there for apparently \nno reason, taking calls and drinking coffee, the greater the impact on office morale. Get rid of such a person \nbefore it's obvious even to the temps you need to, but haven't. \n\n\nBut however you approach terminations, remember this rule: when you get rid of someone, never": null, " \never give them a hook with which to get back into your organization. \n\n\n\"H \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0435 Make a clean, definable and irrevocable break.

You can guess by now that I\u2019ve never been one to sit around and cogitate, especially when I \nknew that swift, decisive action would make the difference between a vice-like grip on a multi-million-dollar \ndeal and a handful of air. I couldn't have made 75,000 business decisions during my career by hesitating in \nthe clutch. \n\n\n\n\n\nWarren Buffet puts it another way. \u201cNever suck your thumb.\" He looks at whatever information \nhe needs, makes up his mind quickly and takes action on his decision. He calls any unnecessary sitting and \nthinking \u201cthumb-sucking.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the legendary Andrew Carnegie asked young Napoleon Hill if he wanted to embark on the \nenormous task of distilling the characteristics of the 500 richest men in the world, he pulled out a stop watch \nand, unknown to Hill, gave him just 60 seconds to make his decision. Hill took just 26 seconds to accepta | \nchallenge that would take him on a 20-year quest. Old man Carnegie knew the value of decisiveness as an \nessential attribute to completing an epic task such as Hill's. \n\n\nBeing careful doesn't mean moving slow any more than taking immediate action means you have \nto rush-in unprepared and do something stupid. We all make decisions in our lives, even trivial ones, based \non several types of input-information available, previous experience, intuition, and the advice of others. \n\n\nYou decide where to take your car to be serviced. You decide how to handle your health insurance, \nand who to hire as your administrative assistant.

In the iate summer of 1986, Charlie Soladay, my Chief Financial \ner, happened to sit next to an executive of MAPCO, a large multinational energy corporation based in \nicky. (Occasionally some moron will ask, \u201cWhy do you always fly first class? That S a lot to pay for free \nand silverware.\u201d Of course, with as much as I travel, I upgrade with frequent flyer miles, but in case \nven\u2019t heard, top executives fly first class so they can strike up conversations with other executives, and \ntions can lead to deals that lead to more deals and more revenue. You're not going to find a deal in \n\n\n8 sitting beside Joe Lugnut and his family.) \n\n\nSo this energy executive, confident and relaxed, confided to Charlie he was working on a project \nthe assets of a Canadian energy company\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, a firm called Bow Valley USA. The \ncluding CitiCorp Canada, were squeezing Bow Valley\u2019s multi-billion dollar parent company for \nit of loans, so it was planning to liquidate assets to pay down its debt load. \n\n\nAs usual, Charlie was paying attention.

Due to worldwide over-supplies, the oil recession was deepening by the \nday. The spot price of oil had dropped from $28 a barrel in January to less than $10 by June. (That seems like \nan eternity ago, with the present-day price around $125 a barrel.) Great Western stock had plummeted from \nthree pounds (about $3.50) on the London Exchange in December 1984 to about 50 pence, or 80 cents, by \nlate June, 1986. Even the monetary exchange of dollars to pounds worked against us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery company in the oil industry was digging in, assuming the fetal position, and covering its \nhead to wait out the recession. That was fine with me. I had decided that Great Western was not going to \nparticipate in the recession. I knew this was the perfect time to make the Quantum Leap we'd been waiting for \n- if we could just find the right acquisition out there in the bone-filled desert of distressed energy companies. \nIknew the financing was there for the right deal. I knew that we could move quickly across the terrain in our \nsearch, because nobody else was out there looking to expand. They were all quivering under their boardroom \ntables! We had already looked at a lot of possible deals, but so far nothing quite right had come along. Until \nCharlie met his talkative new friend. \n\n\nSo as soon as he landed in Denver, Charlie called me at the office in Houston, and reported what \nhe'd heard. Mark and I immediately sat down and began to kick around ideas and postulate some possible \nstrategies for somehow getting a piece of what might be a major opportunity for Quantum growth that Charlie \nhad uncovered. What we were doing was taking Step One. \n\n\n\n\n\nStep One - Identify the Idea. \n\n\nThis is absolutely the first thing you have to do - define and clarify exactly what you want to do, \nor what deal you want to develop. Not only do you and your partners have to agree on the basic strategy of \nthe idea, you have to agree that it may be feasible and will benefit the company. Just as important, if it proves \nto be feasible, you'll have the desire to do it. \n\n\nIn many cases, the major benefit of an idea is not so much profit-driven as it is a vehicle to move \nyou closer to your long-range vision for your company. My vision of Great Western was for it to become \u0430 \nnatural resources company, and a major player in the international energy industry. And my grand strategy for \nachieving these goals, as you may recall, was through external growth through acquisitions, versus internal \ngrowth through continuing oil drilling and production. \n\n\nWe were established in oil and gas, but Bow Valley's assets were based 75% in coal mines an \n| giing postions. Was there an DI CROLEY here for us to look beyond our oil and sax based assets t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\ncnapter / * 11 Steps Lhat Make the Veal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nking to do about how to shape an idea into a plan. My instincts, which I knew were almost never wrong, \ntold me immediately that this was the deal we had to have to make the breakthrough into the energy big \n- Jeague. As \u0413\u0443\u0435 said in a previous chapter, the deal was obviously hot! I didn't have to run a spreadsheet. This \nwas Pamela Anderson running up the beach stark naked toward me, saying, \u2018Dan, here I am! Take me.\u2019 You \nbet, Pamela! Somehow, some way, we had to make this son-of-a-bitch happen! \n\n\nThere was yet another factor that urged me to go for it. \n\n\nWe had achieved a string of conquests that had begun with taking the company public. Our people \nwere confident, even cocky, about taking on the whole energy industry. We were young, undefeated, obviously \nortal, and \u201cready for the title fight.\u201d The mood at GW was electric with anticipation of our next victory. \nould have found it hard to deny them - and deny me a shot at the big one. A shot at glory! But no matter \n\n\nipline our actions, and to train and prepare our minds and spirits for the battle we were contemplating. \nThere were even more basic reasons for giving shape and form to our idea. If you rush past \n\n\nOne, you and your partners may well be hurtling down different paths of thought, pursuing different \njectives, until it\u2019s too late to regroup and re-strategize. Just like getting overrun by the enemy in battle, it\u2019s \n\n\n\n\n\narly impossible to recover your original positions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother reason to identify the idea is that you'll need to communicate it to others in your \nation who may be working nights and weekends to bring it to fruition. And at times like this, virtually \n\u0411\u043e\u0434\u0443 is working nights. In addition, of course, you'll have to commit your idea to paper with crystal \non so investment bankers, brokerage firms and nervous shareholders will understand your objectives \nsupport them. (Again, we're talking about clarifying your vision. Funny thing about a fuzzy idea - it \n't stick to paper very well!) \n\n\nOnce you've identified and agreed upon the nature of your idea or plan - not the details - and its \ntential for benefit to your company, you're ready for Step Two. \n\n\nMore specifically, investigate before you invest time, effort and especially money you could more \nallocate somewhere else. Any action being taken by another organization, group or individual \n\n\n\u041a\u0443 coal company, interested in Bow Valley's oil and gas assets as well as its coal interests? We learned \nwanted to purchase the company, then flip the oil and gas assets over for resale for a tidy no-risk \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhy should Bow Valley sell assets direct to Great Western, they reasoned, when they could buy those \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT \n\n\n(89) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsame assets, mark them up and sell them to us? More to the point, why sell to a much smaller company such \nas Great Western, with no apparent financial horsepower, and certainly not as strong as MAPCO? That was \nthe conventional wisdom they were using. \n\n\nWhat was Bow Valley\u2019s financial status? What was the extent of its operations, in Canada, the US \nand worldwide? How strong were its coal contracts, with whom and under what terms? We had volumes of \ninvestigation to do quickly, but we couldn't afford not to turn over every rock and look beneath it. \n\n\nInvestigation is a search for \u201cred flags.\u201d How many red flags do you need to see? One. Read your \ninvestigative reports... and listen to your intuition. When the first red flag pops up, when you get an answer \nyou're not comfortable with - or don\u2019t get an answer at all - exit immediately. The tiniest wrinkle in the fabric, \nthe smallest contradiction can explode in your face later. (Our Red Flag Check-list, as well as the 11 Steps to \nExecution are listed in Appendix C and A). \n\n\nInvestigation is an integral part of a high performance, and is vital to protect the interests of the \nhigh performance individual who runs the company. These days I\u2019m pursuing deals potentially even larger \nthan anything we did at Great Western, so I retain the services of a full-time private investigator even now \nwho looks into every company 1 even think about seriously, and every person I consider hiring or becoming \nassociated with. We call them \u201ctargets.\u201d \n\n\nThat means you do more than call up the references on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, or chat with a few happy - \ncustomers who are pre-selected and conveniently listed in a company presentation piece. \n\n\nIf you're thinking about doing a deal, you need to check out two targets - the company, and \nthe individual principals of the company. So where do you start? You start with what you know - full \nname of person, address, approximate age, occupation and name of his or her company. Basic information \ncan come from business cards, industry directories, the Standard and Poors directory, telephone directories, \nconversations with others in the industry and annual reports. When you're waiting in a lobby or an outer office, \ndon\u2019t pick up the damned TIME magazine. Check the desks and walls for awards, certificates, photographs \nand diplomas with specific information you can jot down. \n\n\nWhile you're in an executive\u2019s office, look around discreetly as you chat. Compliment your host on \nsome piece of art or knick-knack, and get him to talk about himself. If you spot evidence of a common interest \nor background - golf, fishing, travel, military experience - use that as a lever to pry out more information. \nPeople, even busy executives, enjoy talking about themselves - and you should enjoy listening. \n\n\nInformation is only hearsay until you confirm it.

Rather than getting bogged down in an \ne number of bureaucratic variables, let's talk about this area of investigation in general terms, so you \ntand why this depth of investigation is important. \n\n\nCheck to see if an individual has a pattern of litigation. Civil litigation files are kept in the county \nel and the Federal District level. While you're checking individual targets, check the company for litigation \nYou might find civil suits over breach of contract or debt payment default. Anybody can be sued for \ng, of course, but if a principal of the target company or the company itself has a record of breach-of- \ntracts suits, you need to know before you make a decision about pursuing your deal. \n\n\nCheck to see what law firm they use while you're at it. A high-profile law firm means they are sued \noften, that they're combative and are willing to pay top dollar to enter and win a suit. That's good to \nfront. \n\n\nIt's also good to know if the guys who may soon be smiling at you from across the table have \nrecords. Check them out long before you sit down at the table. You may not realize it, but criminal \nction information is available on many county and state levels, as well as the federal level.

' You bet! By the time I'm sitting down \nto hammer out a deal with an individual or team of people, I\u2019m going to have a file on every one of them. If \none of those mooches has a birthday coming up, for instance, I'll know about it and make damn sure we're | \nstill negotiating late that afternoon, so he's under pressure to make a deal and get to his birthday party. \n\n\nStep Three - Investigate Specifics. \n\n\nRe-check your sources for details you might have missed. Then if you're in doubt about your \nsources, investigate them. Go deeper. If you're about to risk millions, don't think twice about probing beneath \nthe calm surface waters of an apparently straightforward company or individual. \n\n\nBefore you bring in a partner, for example, check not only with his previous associates who may: \ngive you a prepared story, but with their employees who might give you a different perspective. Does this guy \ndrink too much at parties? Does he do drugs? How is he to work for? Does he abuse employees? Does he beat. \nhis wife? Does he chase skirts around the office? Is he gay? Remember, you're not gathering information for \na testimonial dinner in his honor. You're running your fingers over the fabric of his business and personal life, \nfeeling for stitches that are out of place. Maybe you don't care if he\u2019s a cross-dresser, but you need to know. \n\n\nBy the way, in case you haven't noticed, I\u2019ve talked throughout this book in the male gender.

It\u2019s quite another feat to begin \nup commitments to get into the fight if it begins, and to see it through. \n\n\n\n\n\nAn acquisition deal, even for a world-class specialist like Dan Pefia, is not a picnic. Your partners \n\u2018our top executives should be required to commit themselves publicly to the project at the outset. Given \ndividual knowledge, experience and personalities of any group sitting around any conference table in \norld, you're bound to get varying reactions. It's inevitable, unless you've surrounded yourself with \nmized sycophants. If some of your people have reservations, if there is some facet of the project they\u2019re \n\u0443 over, they need to get it on the table so that it can be dealt with and overcome, or a least acknowledged. \nven I, with all my self-confidence, have tinges of misgiving sometimes. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe preliminary decision-making time is when \n\n\n\n\n\nick to your knitting. You you ask yourself, \u2018Is this an area in which I have, or have \nt to deploy your assets, \n\nources and capabilities in \nyour areas of expertise and \n\n\nexperience. \n\n\nany access to, real expertise? 'When Pat Kennedy and I were \npartners in building a vertically integrated oil company, we \nstrayed into areas of the oil industry we didn\u2019t know beans \nabout. And paid dearly for the experience. One of the lessons \nI learned was, \u2018Stick to your knitting.\u2019 Deploy your assets, \n\n\n\n\n\nresources and capabilities in areas of your expertise and \n1\u0435\u043f\u0441\u0435.

During the \npreliminary discussions about the acquisition of Bow Valley USA, for example, my Executive Vice President \nof Exploration resisted the idea of getting into the coal business. Frankly, he didn't like the prospect of his \noil-and-gas division taking a back seat to a newly acquired coal operation. When he realized that we were \nmoving ahead with or without his blessing, he eventually came over, and even convinced himself the project \nwas his idea. Whatever works. \n\n\nStep Five -Make the Preliminary Decision. \n\n\nYour Dream Team, including those with questions and uncertainties, buys into the commitment \nand makes it their own. Make it clear that this is not the final decision, but a working consensus or agreement \nto move ahead. Your investigations thus far have turned up no red flags which would cause you to reconsider \nor walk away from the deal. The deal still looks red hot. You have begun to prepare for battle. \n\n\nIt's at this point, in the preliminary stages of the process, that your people have to become obsessed \nwith an idea that is now going to rise like a monster, assume a life of its own, and dominate their waking \nhours for weeks and months. You're the leader, so now you have to be the cheerleader. I was called the Vince \nLombardi of the oil business. You've got to help your team get absolutely psyched up, generating enough \nenergy, adrenaline and momentum so that, when the battle is joined, they suck up their pantyhose and charge \ninto the cannon with no thought of defeat, fatigue, hunger, sex or any other pre-occupation. If that means \nstringing banners across the conference room, or pep rallies, or promises of bonuses when the deal is done - \ndo it! Do it all. But ignite that obsession, so that your people, from your partners to the mail clerk, know it's \nnot business as usual. You're on war footing and like MacArthur said, \u2018There is no substitute for victory.\u2019 \n\n\nFor the record, my warriors at Great Western made me proud. We never lost in battle, nor knew \nhow to lose. We acted as if we had no limits to our abilities. That became our war cry. If you want similar \nresults, you should act the same. \n\n\nStep Six \u2014 Continue the Investigation. \n\n\nThis is nota redundant step. Frankly, your investigators, whether staff people or an outside firm, \nshould continue their work for as long as your project is a viable one. By definition, you don\u2019t trust the poor \nbastards you\u2019re trying to buy, nor those who may be competing with you for an acquisition. You simply don\u2019t \nbelieve anything they tell you, or that you hear or read about anyone, since all parties are now posturing to be \nin the best negotiating position. Over the course of a major deal, you'll be bluffed and bullshitted and plain \nlied to, directly and indirectly. You'll be lied about as well.

It is! \n\n\nAs you can see by now, these Eleven Steps are not necessarily sequential": null, " in many cases they \nparallel. Investigation never stops. Affirmation of your goal should be continuous. Your pep talks, your \nious enthusiasm, your total commitment all service to replenish the emotional drain on everyone in your \nization for as long as it takes, even unto death, to consummate your deal... or in our case, for the \n\n\n\n\n\nnow to swallow the whale. \n\n\np Seven - Formulate Your Action Plan. \n\n\nThere comes a time in your planning and talking when you have to draw the line in the conference \ncarpet Every indicator, every director, every partner may say go, but you have to push the button - or \nI the trigger. Once you're convinced you can do the deal, and you can almost feel your toes digging in, \nmuscles tightening to make that Quantum Leap, you may have to persuade, cajole, beg, scream and \nly - whatever it takes to make a// your partners step over that line of final commitment. Chances are, \nwever, you've chosen partners with the same clear vision and sense of mission you have, so at some point \njn your strategizing, everybody sort of looks at each other and knows in his gut... God, we're going for it. \nu put your heads together, load your guns, count to three and come out smoking like Butch Cassidy and \nthe Sundance kid. It's a magical moment, that fusion of minds, spirits and souls - it's a rush you will continue \nHe to search out forever! \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd before it\u2019s all over you\u2019re going to need all the magic you can get! Once you\u2019re committed, \nand your company is committed, it\u2019s up to you to keep initial momentum at fever pitch. Regardless of the \nlocks, snags and ambushes you run into, you never by word or groan, express a doubt. As I\u2019ve said \nfore, I may be wrong, but I\u2019m never in doubt. Even the slightest negative reaction can rip like wildfire \nough your company\u2019s morale. During periods of high company stress, employees who are working hard \niS hell for you need constant re-assurance that everything's going to be all right. Like little kangaroos, they \nWant to stay in a warm secure pouch. Give them that pouch. \n\n\nIlearned this lesson the hard way. During the heat of our negotiations over Bow Valley USA, \nI made a casual comment to one of my associates to the effect it was looking pretty touch-and-go right now. \n\u0435\u043f I flew off somewhere on business. My associate mentioned my comment to his wife. She ran into \ncompany wife over at the health club and told her. By the time I got back, I had all but hari-kari in \nhallways. The word was out from the CEO himself - we're going to lose this deal! We're going down in \n. I stomped through our offices, stamped out the fire, and re-learned a lesson I already knew: Share \u0430 \nPe, share a dream - but never share a doubt. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201e7 \n\n\n@) \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlp \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmith Jupiter. The son-of-a-bitch is off-course 95% of the time. Technicians on earth are continually beaming. \n\n\nAt this point you begin to formulate your Action Plan. This is the blueprint that keeps you pointing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin the general direction you want to be headed as you travel through the process of the deal. \n\n\nThe first step of your Action Plan is: Define your Desired Outcome. What do you want? What do \nyou need to get out of this deal? The answer is not something vague like \u201ca lot of money\u201d or \u201ca bigger share \nof our market.\u201d Have your pencil-necked analysts run several what-if scenarios that spit out your worst-case, \noptimum and best-case results. \n\n\nNumber and write down the elements of your Desired Outcome. Start with the whiteboard in your \nconference room in front of all your decision-makers. Make hard copies and distribute them to associates \nand staff. All those people who are going to be busting their chops for the next several weeks or months need \nto know what you want to come out of the nights and weekends you're asking them to sacrifice. \n\n\nStep Two in your Action Plan is: Define your \"Pay-Price-to-Action.\" Remember - your pay-price- \nto-action is how much you're willing to pay, to forfeit in order to achieve growth. Even the sweetest deal, \nunless you're a purse snatcher, requires that you give up something in order to gain something. If you don't \ndecide in advance how far you're willing to go, how large a price you're willing to pay, the momentum of | \nevents later, in the heat of negotiation could well push you into giving away the store. Define your parameters \nnow- and stick within them. \n\n\nStep Eight - Establish Your Critical Path. \n\n\nBy this time in your Action Plan, you and your other decision makers need to chart the critical \npath, the sequence of events which must fall into place for you to achieve success. You also need to set up an \ninstrument by which to measure your progress toward that success. How in hell can you know where you are \nat any given time if you don't know where you're supposed to be? Like a construction manager or a project \nengineer, for example, you develop a flow chart, an optimum time line for securing bridge financing, nailing \n\n\n\n\n\ndown loan guarantees, and starting face-to-face negotiations. You need measurement, because it gives you \u00e0 \nsense of discipline and order.

Or anyone. Even \nyour key decision makers. \n\n\nIn order to relate how minds and loyalties Check every detail yourself, \n\n\nchange, let me give \u0430 little background. We had originally \n\nhad in mind to purchase just the-oil and gas assets of Bow \nValley USA, but MAPCO shunned our interest in a joint venture acquisition. They treated us like a pesky \nlittle kid, which pissed me off. But I saw their rejection of Great Western as an opportunity - to go for the \nwhole company! Of course, we hadn\u2019t set up the financing for the oil assets yet. But this was an opportunity \naring us in the missionary position. And we jumped on it! \n\n\n+ The complexities of pursuing a multi-million-dollar business deal are akin to constructing a giant \nhouse of cards. Every link at every level has to hold in place simultaneously. A high performance individual \nmust have the tact, patience, strength and delicacy to add one \u201ccard\u201d after another without the whole damn \nng collapsing... and the clarity of eye to catch trembling, wavering elements and shore them up before they \nap and fall. That\u2019s where follow-up becomes a fine art. \n\n\n1 Great Western's largest shareholder was an arm of the Kuwaiti government. Although, only \nie guarantor was initially required, the Canadian owners of Bow Valley USA now insisted that both our \ngest shareholder, the Kuwaitis, and our stock brokerage firm, in London, guarantee the deal. The Kuwaitis \nreluctantly agreed to guarantee the entire transaction, but suddenly they were backing away from their \nment, because they didn't want their name disclosed in the documents. Meanwhile, our brokerage \nin London was going through senior personnel changes, and our allies in the deal were replaced by \ncompany personnel we weren't so familiar with. I flew to London to steady up our \u201cfriends.\u201d And \ntiations began in Los Angeles, handled for us by Mark. Why Los Angeles and not their office in Denver? \netter yet, our office in Houston or London? Because Mark's wife was about to have a baby in LA. Nice \n-.. bad mistake. \n\n\nFinally, just as I got the guarantees, and Charlie got bridge financing in New York, negotiators for \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe parent company of Bow Valley USA closed their briefcases and walked out on Mark in Los Angeles. They \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwere actually heading for the L.A. airport while I was holding a board meeting in London to secure approval \nfor the deal. \n\n\nThe final outcome of what was becoming an intercontinental fiasco is not so important here as the \nfact I had constantly to follow up, almost hour by hour, on events in New York, London (where the Kuwaitis \nwere) and Los Angeles.

Chances | \nare you'll run across some glitch, some uncrossed \u201c\u0457\u201d or undotted \u201ci\u201d, from weeks or months ago, which now \nprevents you from taking the Execution Step. \n\n\nSix days had passed since the team from Canada had packed up and left Mark in L.A. Our Kuwaiti \nassociates had lost face and were fuming. Foreign tax issues had arisen. Now the Canadian government. \nostensibly had to approve any deal. My Executive VP of Exploration was running through the corridors of \nGreat Western saying, \u2018J told you so!\u2019 Even our own auditors had recomputed real taxable income before \nand after the proposed acquisition, completely changing our projected rate-of-return. The whole deal was \ndisappearing down the crapper. Conventional wisdom pronounced it dead. Imagine what Dan Pe\u00f1a had to \nsay about that! \n\n\nDuring those six days of hell, I took direct command of the littered battlefield, and began an \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnsive of threatened injunctions, motions and filings in New York, California and Canada. I promised to \nevery moron on the Canadian board of directors, their mothers and their unborn children. I spent more \n100,000 in legal fees in 48 hours. \n\n\nAnd on the seventh day... it worked. The pouting Canadians and Great Western, with key advisors \nDan Pe\u00f1a, convened in one room around a 40-foot conference table. Our team of six stood against their \nm of 20. Our lead transitional lawyer was Rick Scott, one of my first \u201cdisciples,\u201d who went on to found a \nion-dollar healthcare corporation, at one time the largest in the world. \n\n\nWe had met their demand to hold talks in their lawyer's office. But I took control. I stood, looked \nCanadian in the eye and told them that we would \"either breathe life back into this deal or crush the \n\u043e sae bitch out of existence. And nobody leaves this room m one or the other has occurred. We have \nin the corners of the room to serve as urinals. Peri \n\n\nAnd so it began. From the outset, no figure, no projection provided by Bow Valley\u2019s parent \nnpany was taken at face value. Our accountants at Coopers & Lybrand had combed through the financials \nCanadians were required to provide us, and by the time we sat down we had a clearer fiscal picture of Bow \nUSA than its own parent company had! \n\n\nBitter arguments erupted like gunfire at the slightest provocation. As an example, their books \nowed Net Operating Losses (NOLs) of $10 to $12 million, on which we figured to pay maybe 50 cents \nthe dollar. It was built into our purchase price. Then they announced a new NOL estimated at $50 to $60 \nion, and demanded the same 50-cent payment. That was insane! Out of the question! To agree to such a \nd would jack the purchase price far beyond our ability to pay, and collapse our tediously constructed \nof cards. We raged in disagreement. Our attorney advised me, \u2018Dont roll on this one, Dan. Don't \nin. Screw \u2018em! Let walk!\u2019 But we were committed. We had to fight - so we charged! We eventually \ned closer to $100 million in NOLs, even more than the damn Canadians had figured. And we wound \ning 10 cents on the dollar. \n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, 72 hours and two fist fights after we'd begun, the deal was done. No one was ready for \nnd of gut-wrenching ordeal we lived through. No previous experience could have conditioned any of \nluding me, for what happened in the name of \"negotiation.\" Anyone who was there during those three \nDecember days will never forget it. I get goose bumps and a lump in my throat just writing about it. A \nOf beauty born in terrible conflict. \n\n\nBottom line? Great Western paid $116 million for Bow Valley's coal operations and $25 million \ntheir oil and gas interests. Additional oil and gas assets cost us another $7 million. We raised $168 million \n$85 million in short-term loans from our bank", " and $85 million from Series B preference shares of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour First 100 \u0443\u0448\u043f\u043e\u043f \n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Western stock, which were gobbled up by our Kuwaiti friends.

In sight of the fortified camp, he aligned his army along the length of a river bank, placing \n~ their backs to the deep, swift waters. \n\n\nSun Tzu, in his classic, The Art of War, relates that the soldiers of Chao enjoyed a good laugh \nwatching their enemies line up along the river. Then almost immediately the army of Chao left its fortifications \nand attacked Han Hsin's army. With their backs to the turbulent water, Han Hsin\u2019s men fought so fiercely they \noverwhelmed the army of Chao, put them to flight and killed their king. \n\n\nAfter the battle, some of Han Hsin\u2019s officers questioned his strategy. The general replied, \u201cIr is \nwritten, \u2018Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive": null, " plunge it into desperate straits and it will come \nrough safely.\u2019 \"If I had not placed my troops in a position where they were obliged to fight for their lives, \nbut had allowed each man to follow his own discretion, we would have suffered a rout.\u201d \n\n\nFor five millennia, Chinese militarists have subscribed to the strategy of \u201cburning the boats and \nbreaking the cooking pots,\u201d acts that told their armies, in effect, \u2018We have no Plan B. We fight or die.\u2019 \n\n\n\n\n\nMy return to military analogies throughout this book is no accident. Many of my skills and \nitudes about leadership originate from my years in the Army. (At the same time, of course, I know a lot of \n-minded high performers who never saw the inside of a military base.) I believe strongly in the need for \nipline which military training instills in individuals. Without personal discipline we are little more than \n5. A leader with a self-imposed code of discipline commands the high ground to impose discipline on \n\u201e and to lead, whether platoons or corporations, by moral force. And make no mistake, much of being a \nformance super star is leading yourself and others against the popular pap of conventional wisdom. \n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the strongest American presidents - Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln - were \nipered as young men in the fires of war. General Dwight Eisenhower built an enormous fighting force of \n\u0430\u0437\u0443 Allies, coordinated the advance of thousands of ground, air and sea forces, and orchestrated victory \ncruel beaches of Normandy.

His men loved him. His army of the Potomac was larger than the \nforces it opposed. But he couldn't bring himself to make the decision to fight. He acted as if didn't believe in \n\n\nhis own abilities to conduct war. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn business, as I've said, you must act as if there are \u043b\u043e limits to your abilities. Add to that - you \n\n\nmust act as if failure is not an option. \n\n\nIn the late summer of 1986, I sent Charlie Soladay to New York with instructions not to come \nback without bridge financing for our deal to buy Bow Valley USA. He stayed ten days, and worked day and \nnight, negotiating with CitiCorp, our bankers, for bridging financing, and Salomon Brothers, the old line Wall j \nStreet brokerage firm, to underwrite the required loans. It was year's end, and as with all major players in this \nindustry, their plates were full with bigger fish than us. \n\n\nI knew they'd be listening to our proposal very carefully, and watching us closely for beads of \nnervous sweat. Investment lenders use intuition too. So our strategy was to act from an irrevocable position. \nof incredible confidence, as if the deal was virtually a given, the financing was a fairly standard proposition, \nand the chance to participate in that financing was a privilege sweetened with potential for enormous profit. \nAccordingly, Charlie calmly paid CitiCorp $250,000 and Salomon Brothers $500,000 up front just to I \nat the deal! That money, which would become part of the overall fee if they handled financing, was \nrefundable. Even in the Eighties, $750,000 was an impressive sum, and represented a huge portion of c: \nfor Great Western to lay out, considering we only had about a million total in cash! And admittedly, this \na radical departure from the way I usually handled fees, but in desperate times, \u201cyou gotta do what you gott\u00e1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine how those buttoned-down bankers, conservative by nature, perceived our level \nconfidence. Charlie had just pushed them to the table by handing them $250,000 in advance. \n\n\nOver at Salomon Brothers, meanwhile, we had gotten their attention as well. I can see them wi \neyed, rubbing their little palms greedily, saying, \u201cThis must be a hell of a deal, for Pe\u00f1a to plunk down hi \n\u0426\u0430 mil in advance.

And the \n\n\nlarger the company, the more complex and intimidating the structure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, such corporate giants as Sears, GM and IBM have become classic examples of \nthis truth. And, of course, the federal government, plodding through its paperwork and bureaucratic bullshit, \nis the grand daddy of them all. \n\n\nHaving said all that, we need to remember that structure itself is not inherently bad, indeed it is \nbsolutely necessary in some form, so that a company maintains a semblance of orderly operation. \n\n\nStrategy is entirely different, almost the antithesis of structure. It requires thought to exist. \nStrategy implies movement toward an objective, and is fluid in nature. It is a plan created to propel and \nutilize people and resources efficiently, cost-effectively - and especially profitably. Whereas structure has no \nknown origin but is framed and hangs in the lobby, strategy has many sires, and is scribbled in marker on a \ne | whiteboard. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn too many companies today, strategy follows structure. Executives trying to develop strategy in \npursuit of a passing opportunity must scramble through the gridwork of existing structure, seeking approvals, \nfollowing form, observing protocol. The aforementioned corporate entities, e.g. Sears and GM, are textbook \nxamples of strategy following structure. (During the mid-Nineties, this trend abated, as companies returned \nto more flexible, more participatory management structures.) \nAt Great Western, I emphasized continually the dictum that \u201cStructure follows Strategy.\u201d We \nlaintained a basic organizational structure, of course, - a CEO, three EVPs, mid-level management, etc. But \noon as we made the decision to take action on a project, such as an acquisition, and formulated strategy, \nhad the flexibility to remold structure and streamline it to meet the needs of that strategy. Job descriptions \nhanged. Procedures were compressed. And \u201cnormal\u201d working hours became days, night and weekends, \nVhen we were on war footing, we defined structure as whatever the hell it took to keep strategy on target and \nchedule. And our target was winning at all costs! \n\n\nEven more importantly, structure in support of strategy enabled us to maneuver through crisis, to \nindle the ambush of an unforeseen problem as quickly as it arose, and move on. \n\n\nAriving in Conflict \nConflict is part of life. It is a natural phenomenon that results when people act in pursuit of varying \n\n\nts, priorities and desires. Kids fight over toys. Primitive tribes fight over territory. Gangs fight over \n|. Companies fight over market share. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n9 Contrary to what mush-brained idealists would have you believe, conflict is not necessarily bad.) \nConflict weeds out losers, while confirming the right of the superior to prevail. It is how conflict is managed \nor mismanaged that defines its quality. It\u2019s very evolutionary, almost Darwinian, how the doctrine of survival \nof the fittest reveals itself across the corporate landscape in the form of downsizing, mergers and major \n\n\nconsolidations. \n\n\nBusiness deals, especially at high performance levels, distill and concentrate conflict, because \nthe stakes are so high. In global politics, when negotiations break down irretrievably, the parties can go to \nwar, since killing in war is not illegal. But in business the force of law and ethics - mostly law probably - \ndiscourage executives from physically harming one another to get their way. So the ultimate corporate arena \nfor conflict resolution, short of legal action, is the negotiating table. \n\n\n\n\n\nWinning on Your Turf, on Your Terms \n\n\nNegotiating, like super success itself, is not for the touchy-feely. People who'd rather be loved \nthan victorious invariably lose their ass at a negotiating table. As another high performance oil man, J. Paul \nGetty, once said, \u2018The meek shall inherit the earth - but not its mineral rights.\u2019 \n\n\nI love the dynamics of negotiation. Skillful negotiators, of which I am among the best, are forceful, \npersistent, perceptive and patient. I thrive on seeking out and defining my opponent's comfort zone, that : \nimaginary box we discussed in Chapter Four, and then placing an offer on the inside rim of that comfort zone \nclosest to my own best interests. This delicate placement gives the doofus the absolute minimum he'll accept | \nto close the deal and still be able to convince himself he won, that he really stuck it to me. \n\n\nNegotiation is a poker game, played with fortunes at stake instead of chips. To win - and this is \nkey - you must make the other guys think they want what you've got more than you want what they've got. \nAnd, in Kenny Rogers\u2019 words, \u201cYou've got to know when to hold \u2018em, and know when to fold 'em.\" \n\n\nNegotiation is the ultimate in power play. Knowledge of your foe is your most powerful weapon, \nof course, and I maintain a full-time private investigator on my staff for exactly this purpose. But control \nthe physical element of a negotiation is also crucial. From the moment you enter the room, you want as muci \naccumulated power on your side of the table as possible. Accordingly, I have five ground rules for my peopl \n\n\nor myself entering a negotiation: \n\n\n1. Suits required. That seems obvious enough, but I've bargained against morons who wort \ntheir golfing attire to a morning session because they anticipated getting out in time for an afternoon tec-o! \nLe think Dan \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430 adjusted his negotiating strategy to make sure there was no golf that day until he \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@ \n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nChapter 8 * The Plan with No Escape \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. My place. Like any other \u201ccontact sport,\u201d negotiations favor the home team. In my \nconference room, the familiar furnishings, the familiar feel of the chair beneath me, even the lingering aura \nof past victories won there, all contribute to my power level. By contrast, my adversaries are on unfamiliar \nground. They are dependent on me and my staff for coffee and other amenities, and to tell them where \nthe restrooms are - if I decide to tell them. When you're getting ready to hammer a negotiating opponent \nbefore he realizes it, there's no place like home. \n\n\n3. My contract. Always volunteer to draw up the contract. T'I! go ahead and have my people \ndraw up the contract... it\u2019s no problem. 'It seems innocuous enough to offer the courtesy of handling this \ndetail. But now everyone will be beginning with your contract, and the language your Dream Team lawyer \nhas carefully, cleverly written to earn his equity. And you get a first and longer look at what it says and how \nit reads. You enter negotiations with the perfect instrument from your perspective, so the burden is on the \nother side to find and recognize terms, terminology and clauses not to their advantage. \n\n\n4. Nobody leaves until the deal is done. You tell your counterparts in advance that you expect \nthe deal to be signed at the end of the upcoming negotiation meeting, and for them to make whatever \npreparations required for a non-stop marathon. In fact, memo them to that effect. They'll agree, because \nfrom the comfort of their own offices, they can't envision the type of meeting you are already mentally \npreparing for. \n\n\n5. Everyone necessary for a final, definitive decision must be present at the meeting - or \nthere is no meeting. It's like a salesman who must have the \u201cbuying committee\" present in order to close a \nle. If one executive is \u201cnot able\" to attend an important negotiation where million of dollars are at stake, \nOne of two dynamics are occurring. The other party does not want to make a final decision and put ink to \nper before the doors are unlocked... or a key player is revealing an attitude problem and by his absence \nsaying: \u201cI don t like this deal, I don t like you, and I reserve the right to veto every decision and negate \nIl the work invested by both parties\" Either way, it's a negative force which must be resolved before \njerious negotiations can begin. \n\n\nWith all the above ground rules met, the other team arrives at, say, 9 o'clock in the morning. You \nem with friendly formality, offer coffee, and escort them to where you want them to sit. Then you \nassistant and instruct that no one is accepting calls.

At the same time, your message or memo about remaining in negotiations \nuntil the deal is consummated is starting to sink in. He means it. \n\n\nYou have to make some allowance for potty breaks. After all, you did give them coffee. That\u2019s \nwhy the conference rooms of high performance companies have adjoining restrooms. But the point is that \nyou expect no one to leave. Not for another meeting, not for golf at three, not even for meals, which you \nthoughtfully order in. In handling the meeting in this way, you are exerting total power over these unsuspecting \n\n\ndoofuses. Your place. Your contract. Your rules. \n\n\nThe most successful negotiation is the \u201cwin-win\u201d deal. That doesn't mean necessarily that both \nsides win, although that could be the case. An apparent \u201cwin-win\u201d means that each side believes it got enough \nof what it sought to declare victory. Of course, there is no real win- win situation. That illusionary phenomenon \nis a product of today\u2019s feel-good rhetoric, dribbled from the lips of intellectual cream puffs who\u2019ve never \nbeen there and done it. \n\n\nNegotiating styles range across a fascinating spectrum. We Americans, for the most part (except for \nDan \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430), have a basic need to be accepted, and maintain a low-key, patience-driven style. Most executives \nhave been conditioned to be comfortable with a genuine \u201cwin-win\u201d that results in everyone departing filled \nwith satisfaction and mutual respect if not joy and love for all humanity! Because perception is reality, this \n\n\n\n\n\noccurs in theory, but rarely in reality. \n\n\nThe other end of the spectrum is to stay brutal, abusive and inflexible, Such negotiators frankly \nwork on the premise, \u2018We win and take everything": null, " you lose and get nothing.\" \n\n\nDuring the Cold War, U.S. negotiators played hopelessly by win-win rules against Soviet \nnegotiators who wouldn't budge an inch. The Soviets were absolutists, meaning they would settle for nothing - \nbut absolutely everything. Their \u201cnegotiations\u201d with fellow countrymen in Chechen in '95 and '96, consisted \nof leveling whole cities and killing entire populations. This dichotomy of negotiating styles has always \nworked to our disadvantage, and gave rise to the saying, before Vietnam, \u201cWe never lost a war, nor won \u0430 \n\n\npeace.\" \n\n\nToday's equivalents are the despots who rule China, North Korea, Venezuela, Syria and \nabsolutists who only respect power and the will to use it. (Iran will not respect Israel's right to exist until \nIsraeli bombs reduce their nuclear facilities to a hole in the sand. If then.) I am nota despot, but I don\u2019t mini \nbeing perceived as one in a negotiation with those starting with the usual ^win-win\" crap. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\u043e\u0432) \n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nChapter 8 \u2022 The Plan with No Escape \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave someone on your team record the proceedings, or at least take thorough notes, especially of \nthe details of the deal as they\u2019re hammered out. At the end of negotiations, or even at the end of a lengthy \n| session, have those notes typed and printed out in hard copies for the two chief negotiators. It\u2019s amazing how \npeople forget little negotiated points, especially concessions they\u2019ve made in the heat of the moment. So \nmemorialize your deal as your notes reflect it - and leave a little space at the bottom of each page for you and \nthe other chief negotiator to initial. \n\n\nInitialing such a memo shouldn't be a problem, if verbal agreement has already been achieved. \n\nSay something like, \u2018This is pretty standard. We always do this to protect both parties. Hell, sometimes I \n1 forget things myself. ' You read the memo first, before you hand a copy to your counterpart, as if checking for \n| accuracy. Then you initial your copy first to demonstrate your good faith. \n\n\n\"But, Dan, what happens if they send you a contract later in which minor details have been \nchanged?\" Send it back. They're testing to see how your resolve weighs against your desire to get the \n| deal done with no further delay. Send it back immediately. You might even attach a copy of the memo they \ninitialed at the conference table, highlighting the item they've tried to renege on or \u201cadjust.\u201d Don't let them \nweasel out on one percentage point, not one digit or dollar. \n\n\nSometimes, even your most adroit negotiating, your cleverest ploy, will not dislodge a position \ntaken by your opponent. If you can't agree to the point in the deal, say so. \u2018This proposal is unacceptable to \nis as it stands. If you can't work with us to solve the impasse, we'll have to break off negotiations.\u2019 \n\n\nThey'll call you on it, by replying something like, \u2018At this point in the proceedings, we're not \nPrepared to compromise on this particular issue. But we can talk about it some more at a later date.\u2019 \n\n\nSo... without a word, you gather your papers, put them into your briefcase and slam your briefcase \nshut. Your associates mechanically do the same. Then you look at their senior man in the eye and say, \u201cYou \nreach me through my office.\" You and your associates stand up and walk out. If you're in your own \ninference room, you've left the other side to scratch its head in disbelief and find its own way out, or be \nshown out by a secretary. \n\n\nIf the meeting happens to be in their offices, or their attorney's office (the worst place), it's \neven cleaner for you to execute your walk out. Just remember - when you get outside, keep walking - and \nnever, NEVER look back. They're watching you from the windows. Then you disappear from their day, \ngiving them time and space to reflect on their stupid intransigence. \n\n\nThe point is, don\u2019t be afraid to walk out.

A lesser company than Great Western would have accepted \ndefeat, but we wanted that deal. No, we needed that deal more than blood in our veins! And we did what it \ntook to get negotiations back on track. Walking out is a tactic as surely as sitting with your back to the window \nso the other guys have to squint. \n\n\nBy the way, never make an empty promise or an idle threat. Mean what you say, then do it \nwithout a blink - as if you've done it a thousand times. If you say you're going to walk, you'd better damn \nwell walk no matter what.

Another unexpected question. \nBut get your banker to tell you about that deal, even hypothetically. As he relates to you a case of what he \nwas not looking for, you gain a new insight into what he is looking for in a lending relationship. \n\n\n\n\n\n7. What was the last $5 million deal you did? You might not ask this question to a VP at \nBS, Bank of America or Barclays, but for some likely lenders in your community this is a significant \nquestion. You're asking your banker, in effect, to demonstrate his comfort level and skills at maneuvering \nboth of you through the multi-million-dollar lending process. \n\n\n8. Can your institution take me to the next level of my Quantum Leap? How much are \ntheir assets? Once again, as a rule of thumb, banks can lend 1% of total assets unsecured, and 2% to 3% \nof total assets on a secured loan. \n\n\n9. What is your bank\u2019s policy on \u201casset lending\u201d versus \u201ccash flow lending?\u201d By now, \n- Fred is sitting up in his chair, regarding you with a degree of awe. You're already sounding more \nophisticated than 95% of the morons he talks to about loans. \n\n\nIn asset lending, the loan limit is determined by loan-to-value of asset. Take 50% as an \nple. If you\u2019ve got approximately $100,000 in tangible assets, the bank will lend you $50,000. Many \nthese days steer away from asset lending, because in the past, loan defaults have forced them to become \nint property owners. You should look for an asset-based collateralized loan, since most banks will bend \n\nwards to work with you in a pinch rather than take possession of your chain of dry cleaners or pet \n\n\nCash flow lending bases lending parameters on percentage of existing cash flow revenues less \nal expenses, cash costs and taxes, typically between 50% and 65% of cash flow (without \u201csmoke \nors\u201d). If you're already producing income, many banks prefer this basis because they can get their \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[hada on income without the hassle of property ownership or attempting to realize tangible assets. If you're \njust starting, show them how much income your project generates, so that they might consider giving you the | \nloan based on future cash flow. \n\n\n10. Are you an interstate bank, or do you operate just within this state? I\u2019m talking U.S. \nbanks, of course. You'll already know the answer to this one by the time you and Fred sit down. You will | \nprefer an intrastate bank, since it\u2019s simpler to deal with an institution which operates in only one state. \nBesides, interstate banks are subject to more federal red tape and regulations. But again, you'll bank with \nwhomever has the funds and buys your dream! \n\n\n11. Could you give me some recent examples of companies for which your bank has \napproved business loans? \u2018Come on, Dan. Isnt that a little presumptuous, asking a banker who he\u2019s \nlending money to? 'Damn right! So what? You're interviewing banks, and what do you ask for during any \n\n\n\n\n\ninterviews? References, of course. They're going to check yours - so you check theirs. You're not necessarily \nasking dollar amounts or terms - just who. (I will ask about amounts. In fact I'll keep asking questions as \nlong as they give me answers.) If your banker is eager enough to lend you money, he may actually give you | \na list of recent lending approvals. But even if he mumbles some crap about confidentiality or bank policy, \nthese questions keeps him sitting up straight. And it reminds him who's running this meeting. You! \n\n\n12. Do you anticipate any conflict with your present clientele in handling my banking \nbusiness? This is an incidental question that signals to the banker your sensitivity to one of his possible \nconcerns. Chances are slim of a conflict of interest, but it's better to have that question - and its answer - \naddressed and acknowledged. \n\n\nSuppose you establish a working chemistry with an individual banker. You meet for lunch \nperiodically. You play golf. You nurture the relationship for months or years - and then he takes a position \nwith another bank. Do you stay with the original bank? No! The spirit and substance of that relationship is \nwith the individual, not the bank. The bank is nothing more than a mechanism for getting the capital your \nbanker arranges because he's comfortable with you. Unless there are unanswered questions about the move, \nalways go with the banker instead of the bank. Otherwise, you're back to square one at your present bank. \n\n\nFinally, under the area of choosing a bank, don't overlook the option of spreading your capital \nrequirement out over two or even three banks. We'll talk more about that later. \n\n\nHow to Deal with Financial Institutions \n\n\nMost business people make two false assumptions about lending capital: first, that there is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\u00a9\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u044d * Uyjering Lenaers tne < \u043f\u0430\u043f\u0441\u0435 to tinance Your ream \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nite amount of money available for an infinite list of potential borrowers": null, " and second, bankers are your \nversaries, using their office to keep you from borrowing their money.

That means if they're even \n\u04bb\u0430 lfway convinced of the viability of your dream, they'll give you the benefit of the doubt. No wonder \nmost banks, regardless of what they'd have you believe, are \u201c1\u0430\u0443 downs,\" especially with the right \nromancing. An associate of mine at Clydesdale Bank told me in early '97 they were \u00a3788 million \nunder-loaned.

European banks \nflush with capital. \n\n\nThe fine points of how to deal with your financial institution begin to surface during the \nlection phase we've just discussed. The operating premise is that you want to develop rapport, \nderstanding and chemistry with a banker from the first words he hears you speak, and from the \nst time he lays eyes on you. That's why you practice what you're going to say before you blurt \nOut to the banker. And that's why you dress like the sort of business executive that a banker feels \nomfortable talking to and being seen with in the restaurant where he buys you lunch. Remember our \nliscussion about comfort zones? Bankers have comfort zones too, and you want to put yourself smack \nthe middle of it! \n\n\nLet's talk about what you say first. Words have meanings. Words are both weapons and \nols. Remember \"interview\" and what it signals to the banker? If you haven't guessed it by now, \ninkers like to hear words like \u201crelationship,\u201d \u201cpartnership,\u201d \u201clong-term,\u201d and \u201cmutually beneficial.\u201d \nhen you're communicating to a banker you don\u2019t ever \u201cneed money.\" To a refined and sensitive \nnker, that's pretty coarse. Instead, you have \u201ccapital requirements.\" You don't call your accountant \n-pee-a.\" or say 'my Chartered Accountant'. Everyone assumes you have a \u0421\u0420\u0410 or equivalent, \nyou use that term, it sounds like you're impressed you have one. Use the word \"accountant\" in \n\u0455 of the world.

How can you violate the trust of your shareholders by refusing to participate in a deal \n) obviously in the best interests of your institution?\u2019 And it has worked. But I probably have a little more \nerage to scream than you do! The reason you've been turned down may well be that somewhere along the \nay, one of your selling points fell through the cracks. A \u201cNo\u201d really means, \u201cYou haven t given us sufficient \nata to approve your concept. You haven t covered every base and done your job adequately. \" \n\n\nYour response should be, \u201cWhat element do you feel you're missing from the proposal equation? \ne do you have a problem? \" A breakdown in communications is often the simplest of reasons why a deal \nthrough. When Great Western was negotiating to purchase Bow Valley USA for $135 million the deal \nfor some reason. The president of Bow Valley wouldn't return my calls. I finally got hold of him at \nand asked him, \u2018What the hell 5 going \u043e\u043f? 'He said they needed $139 million to close the deal. Damn, \n\n\nthat all, I thought! After all the financial gymnastics we'd been through, another four mil was nothing. 1 \nrew it in the pot and the deal was on again. \n\n\nSo ask! \n\n\nThere's a legitimate reason you've been turned down, and you're not out of line to ask what that \nson is. It could well be something you can easily fix. \n\n\nHere's a great success story to wind up this chapter. Barbara Baade was founder of an employee \nefits consulting firm headquartered in Brookfield, Wisconsin.

Later in the year, she decided to approach a bank with which she had not previously \ned, to see if she could get a loan. She invited the president of the bank to come to her office to talk about \nhing a relationship. Here's what happened in Barbara's own words. \n\n\n\"We spent an hour 'establishing a relationship.' That means we talked about business generally, \n\u0435 banker became comfortable in the realization that I was a knowledgeable, responsible business \na good business.

I used his methods, asked his questions, and $800,000 of growing money floated across my desk.\u201d \n\n\nBankers are not gods, regardless of what some of them would have you believe. They're people - \nwith human needs representing an institution with corporate policies and guidelines which have a great deal \nof resiliency. Make your banker your partner, your co-conspirator in helping you realize your dream. If \nyou're prepared, if you're knowledgeable and professional, and court your banker step by step into what \npromises to become a long-term, mutually profitable relationship, it will suddenly seem he\u2019s working for you \ninstead of his employer. \n\nNow let's move along to some more so-called \u201csecrets\u201d of raising the capital to launch yor \n\n\nQuantum Leap. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n152 \n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\u041a\u0418\u0415\u041d amemo M \u041a\u0428\u0422 \n\n\n\u0430\u0430\u044b\u0440 \u0430\u0451 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter \u0422\u0435\u043f \nMore Capital Ideas for Financing Your Deal \n\n\n\"The business community offers a universe of funding \nsources \u2014 but not one will ever come to you.\u201d \n\n\n[NOTE: As I write this, the nation is in the depths of the worst economic crisis since the Great \nDepression. Many of our largest banking institutions, unable to collect mortgage payments resulting from \nbad loan have floundered, or have been taken over by other banks. Right now, because banks don t trust other \nyanks to repay loans to them, lending from all sources is in jeopardy. \n\n\nNevertheless, the borrowing strategies and tactics I set forth in this and the previous chapter are \nas valid as ever. I encourage you to make presentations, to present yourself to shell-shocked lenders as a \nnfident entrepreneur determined to ride out the crisis and prosper. You may be surprised. To paraphrase \nSinatra, \u201cIf you can make it now, you can make it anytime! \" \n\n\nAfter conducting keynote speeches, workshops and Quantum Leap seminars on both sides of the \ntic and Pacific oceans, I\u2019m still amazed at the enormous gulf that exists between attendees\u2019 academic \nerstanding of searching for capital and their emotional commitment to push that search. \n\n\nOver and over I ask audiences, \u2018 How many of you have made a financial presentation in the \nast 24 hours? Raise your hands. ' No hands. \u2018How many in the past three days? 'No hands. \u2018The past three \n?'Maybe one hand. Maybe. Each time, I\u2019m talking to a roomful of CEOs, business owners and aspiring \nneurs who seem to be paralyzed with fear. We're not talking about a tightrope walk over the Niagara \nhere. You may hate rejection but, as I pointed out in the previous chapter, you will not die or suffer injury \nmaking a financial presentation. \n\n\nSo how do you overcome fear of rejection or fear of presentations? Practice. You raise your \nlevel by forcing yourself to make presentations. I used to practice my presentations in front of a \ngetting down the content, the rhythm, the sequential flow. I practiced when to talk quietly and firmly, \npause for effect - and even when to roar in their faces. (My people today think I've forgotten all but \nSkill.) Nowadays, as much as I know about growing a business - and that's volumes - I still prepare \ntice before every one of my seminars. Every time you make your pitch, even to your dog, you get \n5 smoother and more comfortable with it. \n\n\nM If you're still nervous, take your accountant with you. Pay somebody to go along. But you must \nut there and make presentations. If you ever want to take that Quantum Leap to super success - and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\nE) \n\n\nmake shitloads of big money with every equity transaction, you can't escape, you can't circumvent making \npresentations. Are we clear on that? I hope so. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrecommend, even demand, that my prot\u00e9g\u00e9s make two presentations a week. That's two lunches \nor two meetings with two bankers. After about a month, you'll get pretty comfortable with your pitch. You'll \neven start to vary it based on what you perceive to be the most important factors to your banker-of-the-day, \n\n\nTwo pitches a week isn't that much. Some weeks, since I own significant portions of some 20 |. \ncompanies, 1 make five or six presentations. Keep in mind that two measly presentations is a modest Pay- \nPrice-to-Action for the prospect of netting a small fortune for yourself through your Quantum Leap. \n\n\nSo get off your dead ass... start checking out banks today... and begin making those | \n\n\npresentations. | \nWhen to Begin Meeting with Bankers \n\n\nIn Chapter Nine, I mentioned not waiting until you need the money by Thursday before you call a \nbanker. That was facetious - occasionally I'm facetious - but the fact is, a lot of business people do just that. \nThey decide on Monday to buy out a competitor, grab a hot deal or double the size of their plant, and pick \u0440 \nthe phone to call the bank where they have a checking account. They regard commercial lenders as \u0430 multi \nmillion-dollar ATM machine. /t doesn t work that way. \n\n\nWith banks, you start romancing in May for sex by September. During your first conv \nwith a prospective banker, you start positioning yourself. Say something like, \u201c In six to 36 months, \ngoing to have a funding need, for somewhere in the neighborhood of (x number of) dollars...\u201d quot \nfigure higher than you think you'll need. Then, later, you mention you may need \"interim financing\" in thre \nto six months. And after a few weeks, after two or three meetings, and maybe a round of golf, you hit then \nfor the amount you need with your drop-dead presentation. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Value of Your Board of Directors \n\n\nBankers enjoy all the dancing around before they go to bat for you. Your banker doesn't V \nbe embarrassed by your not paying the loan back, so when you mention your board of directors, he's. ik \nto say, \u2018Oh I'd like to meet your board the next time we get together.\u201d You think, this moron doesn't b \nhave a board. You say, \u2018Oh, good. In fact, my board members have expressed an interest in meeting You \nif that would be helpful to the lending process.\u2019 \n\n\n\n\n\nH \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 HAE wou \u0410\u0420\u041e\u041d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll recall that in the chapter on building your Dream Team, we discussed the value of a board of \ndirectors. So if you don\u2019t have a board of directors, get one. It can be very helpful to you, and has virtually no \n\u2018drawbacks. But rather than your drinking buddies and cousins, go for business people with some recognition \njn your business community. Bankers understand that retired successful executives, with no financial worries, \nare usually very concerned about their reputation. They would not be associated with a company they feel \nwould damage the good name they've built over decades in the business community. Once again, as with a \njoint venturer, you're borrowing their credibility to boost your own. \n\n\nUsing Your Banking Business as Leverage \n\n\nYour present bank may be your strongest possibility for a loan. It's certainly the most obvious. \n\n\nThen, when you have a lending relationship established with your new bank, and you're still on \nour honeymoon with them, begin negotiating to move your deposit business, payroll and other miscellaneous \nss. Demand concessions for the inconvenience of moving everything. Begin with personal lines of \nt for all your executives and managers. Request re-financing of home mortgages at the best possible rate. \nof course you'll need credit cards for yourself and your people at the highest limits issued. In return, \n\u00fc may want to accept no interest on your deposits, as I did when I was starting out. (I don't mean demand \n\n\nPart of the expertise of raising capital is understanding what the hell your banker or a specialist \nny \u2018other type of lending is talking about, especially when they discuss such often esoteric items as debt, \nity and credit.

So suck up your pantyhose, sign your name, and go \nforit. Are you really prepared to back it yourself? This is the acid test of whether or not you believe in your \nown dream. \n\n\n* Lines of credit - You absolutely need an unsecured line of credit - or an \u201coverdraft\u201d in the \nUK and other parts of the world - from a banking institution. Thanks to tireless marketing, virtually everyone \nhas a line of credit these days, if only Visa, MasterCard or Discovery. But as an entrepreneur looking for \ncredibility, you'll need something a little more substantial to point to when a potential lender asks, \u201cDo you \nhave an unsecured line of credit?\u201d When you can say yes, your lender understands that some other banker \nsomewhere has investigated your credit record and has put enough trust in you to give you unsecured credit, \nIt doesn't matter what amount. But if you have to say no, your lender is likely to sigh and say, \u201cWell, you'll \nneed a secured line of credit.\" And one more asset in your life or business becomes collateral. In today's | \n\n\nskittish lending market, this is especially true. \n\n\nStart with your own bank. Even if the only people you know there \u0430\u0433\u0435 the drive-in window tellers, \nthey should be able to give you a small line of unsecured credit. If they won't, get a new bank. \n\n\nWhile we\u2019re talking lines of credit and business banking, suppose you need to raise your line of \ncredit? Your banker says no. You reply, \u201cWell, we've had a good relationship here, but your bank doesn fi \nthe profile of the sort of bank we want to be partners with during our period of high growth. You just don't fit \nour pistol anymore, so I think it's time to withdraw...\" Your banker may then say, \u201cUh, how much of a credit \nline do you need?\u201d But if he still doesn\u2019t budge, you must leave and find another bank. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis reminds me of a story about one of my disciples, a Doctor Bokhari who is an alumnus 0F \n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Bokhari\u2019s experience demonstrates two points: first, he understood that he made the rules, not the \u0411\u0430\u043f \nand second even a plastic surgeon who is not primarily a businessman has to go to certain lengths, hov \ninconvenient, to achieve his Quantum Leap. \n\n\n\n\n\nH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\npree amemo jur a maura sumi rime \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Care and Feeding of Your Banking Relationship \n\n\nOnce you get your financing from a commercial bank, you don\u2019t just take the money and run. It is \n\u0457\u043f the best interests of both you and your company to nurture that relationship, to maintain contact with the \nanker or bankers who made your loan possible. After all, you never know when you'll need more financing \n\u0433 another Quantum Leap in the future. In fact, if you stay in business, I can guarantee you'll need more \ncing. \n\n\nBut beyond that, you want to give your bankers a call every few weeks, have lunch, play golf or \ntever, just to find out how things are at the bank. If, for example, conditions change and they find they \nto manage their capital more conservatively, your lines of credit could be cut back. It just pays to stay \n\u0457\u043f touch with your banker. \n\n\nIalso recommend that you take out a loan and roll it from bank to bank. Borrow, say, $50,000 \nBank A. Then three months later, borrow $52,500 from Bank B and pay off Bank A. Four or five months \n": null, " borrow $53,750 from Bank C and pay off Bank B. This rotation of your loan and the act of paying it off \ngive you a track record as a reliable borrower with several banks. Borrow the original amount from Bank \nwhatever purpose you may need capital. Tell Banks B, C, D etc, you're \u201cconsolidating debt,\u201d which \n1 be the truth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome business owners worry about bank fees. Let's face it - bankers will smile and say, \u2018We'll just \nyou within the normal range... 'then stick it to you with fees as large and as often as they can. Bank \nare one of life's mysteries - and certainly one of its necessary evils. But - if that's what you worry about, \nre not entrepreneurial material and need to put this book away. Bank fees are simply not important in the \nheme of things, as long as you have plenty of money...all the time. As I told my banker at the Bank of \nd, \"I really don t care if I pay one or three point over libor (their term for prime rate) as long as I have \nney when I want it.\" I\u2019ve said before that a deal is either hot, or it's not. If your deal is so lukewarm or \nn cold that the odd percentage point is \u201cmake or break\u201d then you need to find another deal. Right? \n\n\nable Financing \n\n\nWe've talked about asset lending and cash flow lending as two types of collateralized financing. \nI Some reason you can't get these or any type of financing - and as a newly emerging entrepreneur you \n- try for what is called \u201creceivable financing.\" This is borrowing money against the receivables \ners owe. Some banks will do receivable financing. With receivable financing, you will normally \n1 the credit relationship by collecting the receivables yourself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceivable financing is sometimes referred to as \u201cfactoring,\u201d and is usually available from other \nthird party lenders such as finance companies which lend you the money you need - or part of it - at interest \nrates just under what\u2019s allowed by usury laws. Most banks will not enter into a factoring relationship. The \nadvantages of factoring are that the finance company becomes responsible for collecting the receivables they \nbuy and for the bookkeeping involved. Also, banks take into consideration that another party has contracted \nwith you to handle collections, so they may become more comfortable in partially financing your entire \nrequired amount. \n\n\nRemember - the main difference between receivable financing and factoring is that, with factoring, \nyou will normally give up control of the paper. \n\n\nIt\u2019s an expensive proposition, but, as I\u2019ve said, sometimes \u201cyou gotta do what you gotta do.\u201d \nDebt Financing vs. Equity Financing \n\n\nWe've been talking about various ways of financing your Quantum Leap through incurring deb \nOf the three ways to grow your business - allocation of revenues, debt and equity financing - the chances \nare overwhelming you won't be able to accrue the revenues you'll need to finance a Quantum Leap. Debi \nfinancing is my least favorite, because you're committed to a debt obligation, plus interest, well into an \nuncertain future. A rise in interest rates or a downturn in business could screw up your ability to service your. \ndebt. Also, if the deal blows up and you lose your ass, your frantic lender will want his money back - even \nout of your flesh. \n\n\nI have always taken the position that equity financing is more advantageous, in that fresh O \nPeople's Money is infused into your company in exchange for equity ownership. This puts those Oth \nPeople in the same boat you are vis-\u00e0-vis the company's survival and profitability. They buy into a share 0 \nyour dream knowing they could lose their investment. Unfortunately, depending on how you structure youll \nequity offering, it also gives them a say in how you go about pursuing your dream. Therefore, before y? \ndilute yourself below 5096, make sure you're well on your way toward your Quantum Leap. \n\n\nDon't misunderstand! You will have to pay some interest on almost all forms of equity infusio \nand it is often a higher rate. \n\n\nWhen I started out with Great Western, I owned 100% of the company.

My own percentage dropped to \n\nod than 45%, even though KIO had put up 78% of all the money. Further financial restructuring during the \n\nre Eighties and early Nineties ultimately reduced my portion of my own dream to just over 15%, but it was \n15% of a $300 million energy conglomerate which would grow to more than $400 million in value (market \ncapitalization) - all from that $820 investment in 1982. \n\n& | \n\n\nDuring those incredible years, we did equity financing wherever we could, and debt financing \never we had to. Under my leadership, every nickel of debt principal was repaid, and our shareholders \n\n\nle a ton of money. \u0410\u041f in all, not a bad track record for a punk kid from East Los Angeles who was expelled \nrom school three times before third grade. \n\n\nVenture Capitalist - Lenders with a Different Agenda \n\n\nVenture capitalists are professional management companies who manage high-risk funding. \nir capital comes from such institutions as corporate pension funds, insurance companies and limited \nnerships, and they typically concentrate on investment opportunities beginning around $500,000. Venture \n\n\nipitalists, myself included, will also use their own money to finance a very promising start-up company with \ngrowth potential. \n\n\nAlthough a venture capital fund will consider many investment instruments, it is not particularly \nted in a fixed income such as interest would generate. Instead, it likes to take equity positions in \nation of taking the company public or selling out in the future. Then, through a public offering (its \n\n\n\u0411\u0443), it stands to make a ton of money. The timetable for execution of their exit strategy varies, but \nbetween three and seven years. \n\n\nVenture capitalists prefer to become involved in the early stages of a deal, and we are especially \nin small companies with big promise (but some Venture Capitalists are only interested in second- \nding). They look for such indicators as sound management and proven track record. If you're just \n\n\n\u0440 Out you might consider a joint venture partner with a track record the venture capitalist would accept. \n\u00a9 primary reason people bring me deals. \n\n\nVenture capitalists are more comfortable risk-takers than bankers too.

Information is readily available from many sources. And you need not tiptoe \n\n\naround venture capitalists. Seek them out and sell them your deal. Give them an equal opportunity to \ninvest in your dream. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much venture capital is available? In 2008, more than 600 active institutional venture \ncapital firms were managing over $35 billion of capital available for investment in early, expansion \nand late stage growth companies. Even in today\u2019s gloomy economy, these figures continue to rise, \n\n\nand indicate that hundreds of billions of dollars are available from venture capitalists nationwide for \ngrowing businesses. Including yours. \n\n\nCorporate Bonds \u2014 the IOU's of Business \n\n\nIssuing bonds, or fixed income securities, is yet another way for a corporation to raise capital. \nJond holders received a fixed rate of interest - the coupon rate - each year, with their original principal \nbeing paid back when the bond matures on a pre-determined future date. There are a variety of bonds which \npany can issue, based on the nature and structure of its business and its capital requirements. \n\n\n* Subordinated convertible bonds or debentures - The company pays the buyer, say, 12% \n\nst on bonds sold to a venture capital firm. Then, at some time in the future, hopefully when the \n\ntakes off, the holder can exchange them for common stock or just collect the interest, or redeem \n\nfor the original face amount when they mature, having collected interest along the way. In the \n\nleantime, debentures are \u201csubordinated\u201d in that they are usually unsecured, and are secondary or \u201cjunior\u201d \n\nbank loans made concurrently or even later. If the company goes belly up, the bank has first claim \ngainst assets, then comes the subordinated bond holder. \n\n\n\u2022 Royalty bonds - The holder receives income from the proceeds of a royalty on a product or \nler specific source of income. \n\n\n* Zero coupon bonds - This popular type of bond was created in the Eighties to attract \nors looking for predictable returns on their investment for retirement or a child's college education. \nTO coupon bonds don't pay any interest, but are sold at a big discount. These bonds, sold by investment \n\nT$ to finance a company's growth, can be a safe investment if the bankers hold Treasury bonds as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour First 100 Mutton \n\n\nOther Sources of Capital \n\n\n\n\n\ntal \n\n\nInsurance companies and pension funds often seek out investments among corporations \nattempting to raise long-term capital, although more typically for purchases of equipment or real estate which | \ncan be taken as collateral. The advantages of this type of funding are usually lower interest rates and long- \nterm maturity of loans. \n\n\nAngels exist! In the corporate world they take the form of individuals or organizations such as \nprivate foundations that seek to encourage and underwrite entrepreneurial efforts which prove themselves | \nworthy of angelic support. \n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Foundations, such as the Ford Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation, are often open \nto funding company growth, especially firms which are active in specific areas of interest or commitment to | \nthe foundation, such as social progress, health care or environmental protection. | | \n\n\nFinally, add to this list of possibilities individuals who have amassed personal wealth often put. | | \nthat wealth to work by underwriting carefully selected corporate growth projects. W. Clement Stone, founder: | \nof Positive Mental Attitude (PMA), is an excellent example of an angel, one who takes no hand in management | \nand only asks a pro rata share of corporate profits in return. \n\n\nWarren Buffett, the legendary investor, is a frequent angel, although he might argue the term per - \nse. 1 recently read where, if you had invested $10,000 with one of the original Buffet partnerships in 1956, and | \nthen nine years later reinvested in Berkshire Hathaway stock, you'd have earned well over $100 million by \n1995, and upwards of $270 million today after all fees were paid. If he isn't an angel, I don't know one! \n\n\nPublic Versus Private Funding \n\n\nTaking your company public is one of the great and heady experiences of the free enterprise \nsystem. The day we watched Great Western Resources make its debut on the London Stock Exchange, August \n10, 1984 (my 39* birthday), is memorably engraved in my mind as an experience I hope to duplicate again if \nmy lifetime. Going public is risky and expensive, costing in fees and other expenses typically 1096 to 20% \u041e\u0413 \nmore of your entire offering, or total capital raised, depending on where you go public. \n\n\nBut to you as a founder who has probably made a substantial investment to grow your compa?) \nenough to go public, your percentage of return in relation to the net worth value of the company can b\u00eb \nincredible. A stock share might score \u0430 10 to 12 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which means it sells at 10 10 \n12 times the company's net after-tax earnings. During a small initial public offering (IPO), this ration m \n\n\nH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nreper ae \n\n\n\n\n\nprime amemo jur \u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d LUI Lea \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwell skyrocket to 30 to 40 times the company's earnings. At Great Western we turned our initial investment, a \n- $60,000 option on mineral rights into $50 million. Even today, it's hard to imagine making that much money \nthat quickly without a mask and gun! It triggers an adrenaline rush with an emotional high that cannot be \n- duplicated! \n\n\nAs with any other business option, there are disadvantages to going public. All confidentiality \nis forfeited. Your business transactions, financial records and even marketing methods must be open to the \nscrutiny of government regulators, suppliers, stockholders, prospective stockholders and even competitors. \n\n\nA public company must also subject itself to internal accountability, particularly the transactions \nbetween the company and its officers or directors. Government regulators are forever sniffing around for \nconflicts of interest, insider dealing and special favors which, if not illegal, would be construed to be not in \nthe best interests of the shareholders. \n\n\nAnother disadvantage, and a supreme irony, is that as you get the financing to reach your dream, \nyou simultaneously lose total control of that dream. As in the example of Great Western Resources during \nthe course of its IPO and subsequent offerings, every time we made a public offering, my own share of my \n\u2018company was substantially reduced. \n\n\nFinally, what I call the \u201cdark side\" of choosing to go public is the almost inevitable consequence \nhat one day you'll have to leave your company, forced out by many of those you invited aboard your dream \nalong the way. The fact is that the days of the entrepreneur with his public company are limited. He may be a \ngenius at envisioning, siring and breathing life into his dream. But unless he also has the patience and skills \nto be a management genius and a great leader, the entrepreneur will sooner or later recognize the approach \nof his own departure. \n\n\nThe bright side of the \u201cdark side?\" He leaves with his pockets stuffed full of lots of money. And he \ncan begin exhilarating adventure again any time he pleases. \n\n\nThe Gulf War in 1991 was my Waterloo. I was ultimately removed as head of Great Western when \nly Kuwaiti \"friends,\" preoccupied with invasion and other internal strife, subsequently transferred their \nloyalties and their voting power to a faction in the company that felt my own time had passed. Although we \nto go to court to settle the issue, Great Western Resources paid me handsomely with a *golden parachute\" \n\u0435 millions, plus a start-up subsidiary in the textile business. And I was the largest individual GWR \nareholder until its sale in January 1997. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n163 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n^ Questions I'm Always Asked About Raising Capital E \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the basic \u2018How do I get the money?\u2019 seminar attendees inevitably ask other questions \nover and over. To prevent someone from asking one of those questions at a future Quantum Leap seminar, I \n\n\nwant to conclude this chapter with a quick \u201cQ&A\u201d. \nQ - How much money should I ask for? How do I figure what to ask for? \n\n\n\u0410 - No matter what you figure your acquisition or IPO or any other Quantum Leap is going to cost \nyou, you can bet your numbers will be short. The only figure you can be sure of is that the bank will loan you \na maximum of up to 2-3% of its total assets on a secured loan. My advice is to ask for three to five times more \nmoney than you think you need. If you get it, you've got a pot of capital you can always use": null, " if you don't \nyou've at least cleared yourself some negotiating room for a smaller loan. \n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, it's actually easier to finance a larger deal, because the bank is more anxious to \"sell\" \nyou more money if you're approved. Bankers have to do /ess to get more money out the door - and their \nbonuses are tied to how much they lend. These are all reasons to ask for more than you think you're going to | \n\n\nneed. \n\n\nQ - I don't have a track record. I\u2019m a new company with nothing to show the bank. \n\n\nA-Find a joint venture partner who does have a track record. Attach your company to an established \nname. You'll recall that nobody at the Defense Fuel Service Center had heard of GWDC, but they had done \nbusiness with Marrion Refining Company. Put together a Board of Directors which includes prominent and \nsuccessful business people who can lend their reputation to yours. Borrow credibility, so you can borrow \n\n\nmoney. \n\n\nQ - How many financial presentations should I make? \n\n\nA- That's like asking \"If I'm trapped in a burning house, how many times should I try to get out? \nAs many times as it takes, Doofus! Make as many presentations as you can! Set your goal for at least tW \npresentations a week, more if you\u2019re trying to raise your comfort level faster. \n\n\nQ - Should I fight for a certain number of points over prime or the lending rate? \n\n\nA - Worry about getting the damn loan, not how many points above prime your interest is goi! \nto be. If that's an issue, if the amount of interest you're going to pay is a big thing, your deal is too ti \n\n\nYou're asking for a loan that gives you no room for error.

Nobody argues with cash. \u201cMoney talks and bullshit \n\u201d If you're making Quantum Leaps and pulling down millions in personal wealth - and a lot of people \ndoing it - you are without question successful. \n\n\nRemember in Chapter One we discussed people who were uncomfortable talking about money? \nUS because the morons never had any to talk about. You've got to become as comfortable with lots of \nhey as you do with success - because real success begets real money! \n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s define Quantum growth by what it\u2019s not. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlg \n\n\nQuantum growth is not making more sales than last year... or picking up new clients. Or adding \nmore products or stores or branch offices, or reducing costs. All of those are indicators of growth all right - \ninternal growth. And more to the point, arithmetic financial growth. We're already talked about this. One \nplus one equals two, two plus one equals three, etc. The healthiest internal growth in any business is always \ngoing to produce only gradual long-term arithmetic growth. Nothing more. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do entrepreneurs settle for gradual, boring growth? \n\n\nThe best that can be said for arithmetic growth is that it's better than no growth at all. And, in \nfact, if your company is only growing arithmetically, it's probably dying. But why does an entrepreneur, an \nuncommon individual who once had a bold vision to build a company, and worked days and nights to see his \nvision come to life - why does this same person now accept the humdrum growth of 4% better sales than last \nyear... or a 2.5% higher profit margin? \n\n\nIt's not as if this person has never known Quantum, skyrocketing growth. The fact is that, in the | \nbeginning, the founder of a successful company did experience Quantum growth. And it was exhilarating! He \nno doubt spiraled from zero to enormous success, maybe growth in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in \nthe first year of business. All business was new business. All money was new money. The growth curve shot \nalmost straight up and soared across the chart like a comet! | \n\n\n\n\n\nhis industry were doing about the same. So everyone was successful. Actually, everyone was satiated.

And, as \u0413\u0443\u0435 said, external growth is only possible through a series of] \nequity transactions. \n\nLet's examine the difference between what we'll call a \u201cproduct\u201d transaction and an equity \nion. A product transaction is essentially an even trade. The profit produced by an almost even trade \n\n\nsubstantial profit. \n\n\nAn equity transaction, by contrast, creates value. A board of directors decides to sell equity to \nise capital. It votes into existence half a million shares of common stock for a public offering. When shares \nvalue has been created from nothing but the perception of value! \n\n\nInvestors, in fact, are buying, not a product, but \na future value that may exist. It's sort of like buying thin air. \nAnd paying cash up front for it! The down side, of course, | \u00a9V@\"! thing you own... don't try \nis that a company cannot go on diluting its ownership | 40 buy a business. \n\n\nIf you're not willing to risk \n\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly, the equity transaction which is the real secret of Quantum growth is acquisition - the \nase of equity assets which enables a company to boost, actually to multiply its net worth geometrically, \n\n\nThen, around 2004, the prices of residential real estate began to skyrocket out of sight. You \nhowitwas.

And for the rest ofthe first decade of the 21* Century, the real estate market stagnated. \n\u041f\u0435 values tumbled, so that those inflated home deals that seemed too good to be true turned out to be just \nwere more For Sale signs than trees in some markets.

AIG was saved by the intervention of the sy \n\n\n\n\n\nfe, who agreed to lend up to $85 billion to AIG in return for an 80% stake in the company.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, that was an election year and Congress vowed financial relief for all those -\u2014 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmorons who lost their ass and their home to the land mines of sub-prime mortgages. \n\n\nBut even in the best of times, these types of investments are only the beginning, not ends in \nthemselves. Flipping houses are the poor man's equity transactions. How infinitely more lucrative is the \nequity transaction in which a company is acquired for, say, $5 million of Other People's Money (OPM), pumped \nand prettied up, and sold for $10 or $12 million! \n\n\nThe Perils of the Leap \n\n\nIf you're contemplating your first business transactions, you need to approach your venture knowing \nin advance the three greatest personal hazards you face. Having the will and determination to clear these hurdles, \nas you'll recall from our first four chapters, is what becoming a super successful high performer is all about. \nHere are the three hazards: \n\n\n\n\n\n1) The depth of personal commitment required. Your acquisition deal must take precedence \nover normal personal considerations. You have to make a total commitment of time and energy. Buying a \nbusiness, especially the first business, is a full-time proposition. If you are trying to hold a job at the same \ntime, you'll either have to quit that job or give up making your Quantum Leap through acquisition. You'll be \nspending days and nights figuring, re-figuring, analyzing and strategizing - and then doing it all over again. \nBecause if you don't, if you do a half-assed job of planning and calculating every step and every nitpicking | \ndetail, you're likely to fail. All this means no days off, no vacations, constant travel and continuous meetings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember my \"doofus test,\" which put a prospective associate under pressure? When you're working \u0430\u043f \nacquisition, your whole life is a doofus test! You sleep on your couch, eat at your desk, work on your bed. | \nYour lawn goes to hell, your friends think you're crazy, and your family stays mad at you for ignoring them, | \nforgetting their birthdays and missing their recitals. \n\n\nYou must have a commitment of support from your family. If not, you have to make a decision: \n- your Quantum Leap or your family. I'm not fooling around here. When I hold my week-long seminars at \nGuthrie Castle, I stress the importance of couples attending - wives or \u201csignificant others\u201d - because the depth \nof commitment required is such that the \u201cother\u201d in the personal relationship must be a signatory to the Quantum \nLeap his or her partner is about to make. On occasion, a castle attendee has ultimately divorced his or her spousi \nor business partner, because the other person was unwilling to make a corresponding commitment to \u201c e \nDream.\u201d \n\n\n2) The total financial risk involved. You must be willing to make a total commitment of y \nfinancial resources... to put everything you own on the table. Sure, a lot of Other People\u2019s Money is availab! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n(\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435 \u0435\u043d\u0435 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut many sources of OPM are looking to see how willing you \u0430\u0433\u0435 to lay your resources on the line first. \n\nMark this sentence: /f you're not willing to risk everything you own, now and in the uncertain \ne, don t try to buy a business.

Here is an important reason why I practiced being \na super successful high performer long before I achieved my greatest success. I knew from what I \nsaw and from what others told me that the Quantum Leap would be no picnic. I knew I would have to \nsuck up my panty hose, act tough, slash enemies, take hostages and kill prisoners to reach my goals. I \nknew, almost instinctively, the pressure would be enormous to equivocate, to compromise, to surrender. \nI foresaw times when, unless I practiced, I would be too wound up, too stressed out, too beat up or just \ntoo damned tired to take actions in my best interest. So I practiced. I thrust myself intentionally into one \nuncomfortable situation after another. I led charges when others retreated. I picked fights while others \nprepared to surrender. And, except for a few modest vices, I\u2019ve kept my body and spirit in peak fighting \ncondition for more than half a century. In Texas, where I battled with the energy giants, they called Dan \n\u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430 \"twisted steel and panther piss.\" Among other things. \n\n\n\n\n\nSooner or later stress can kill most people. Stress no doubt contributed to the loss of my dear \nd and partner Charlie. But the fact is, life eventually kills us all. My feeling is that - no blasphemy \n\n\nHow to find Your First Acquisition \n\n\nWe've discussed in detail the process of raising capital for the purpose of acquisition. But well \nyou arrive at the point of beginning to interview capital sources, there are several basic issues you need \nclarify in your own mind. \n\n\nYou're an energetic, ambitious individual with a three-digit IQ who sees less capable people than \n\u041e\u043f run a successful business, live in luxurious lifestyle, then suddenly sell their company and retire early to \ntropical island. You're an employee now, maybe, but you have the imagination, self-discipline and chutzpah \ntun your own company - and you're tired of working your tail off to make your boss rich. \n\n\nYour first question is - what kind of business? I have some guidelines for answering that question. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\nFirst, as I preach to my disciples, \u201cStick to your knitting.\u201d Look for a business in which you already \nhave expertise. You'll face enough problems (not \u201cchallenges\u201d) borrowing capital, assembling your Dream \nTeam, taking over your company and learning to become a CEO, without having to acquaint yourself with \nthe technical processes and jargon of a whole new industry. Do what you know. Later, after you\u2019ve made \nseveral Quantum Leaps and become more comfortable with the acquisition process, you'll see common \n\n\ncharacteristics, and be able to handle acquisitions regardless of the industry, much as I do now. \n\n\n\n\n\nDo what you Jike as well. Regardless of the problems you run into, your Quantum Leap will seem | \nless harrowing when you're making it in an area you know and from which you derive pleasure. \n\n\nThere are other, practical criteria too. You want to make your acquisitions in an industry which | \nis fragmented, and dominated by mom-and-pop companies. You want an industry that's large enough to | \nhandle your acquisition aspirations. If you're planning to purchase one of three companies that serve what is | \nessentially a limited market, such as buggy whip repair or carbon paper manufacturing, you have nowhere to | | \n\n\n\u0435\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0434. \n\n\nYou want industries that enjoy \u0430 20% to 40% margin. In my own experience, these include such | \nwisely diverse industries as retail jewelry, landscaping, building maintenance, publishing, home improvements \nand trailer parks. If you get into a business with 3% or 5% profit margins, you'll take forever to build your | \ndream. Narrow your focus. You might be interested in healthcare, for example, but you need to find a niche | \nno one else is consolidating, such as child care or senior living facilities. \n\n\nThe size of business you want to acquire depends on the size of your goal, and the clarity of your \nvision. My guess is that if you've read this far, you're looking for more than a steady income and a secure | \nretirement from a couple of dry cleaner operations. I sure as hell hope so!

Martin was already \n\u0430 committed entrepreneur, but after listening to my tapes, attending my seminars and reading the first edition \n\u2018of this book, he decided he was ready to hunt with the big dogs. Here's what he later wrote: \u201cBy the time \nwe met at a London Hotel in December 2000, I had fully absorbed his mindset. I felt I knew him very well \nly. Dan had formed The Guthrie Group (TGG), an investment consortium specializing in facilitating \nsactions. I was determined to join them. Many \u2018doofus tests\u2019 later, and after three months of investigation, \ne finally made me an offer to join TGG. I stayed with the group for over five years, lived at the Castle for \ne and eventually became one of the principals. \n\n\n*Dan taught me how to best hunt for deals. We had over a hundred meetings that I set up with banks, \nnture capitalists and private equity firms. We interviewed \u0421\u0415\u041e\u201d, assessed acquisitions and divestments, \n\u041e\u0437 and SMBO\u2019s. We worked on industry consolidations, and all of us working together sent thousands \n-mails. \n\n\n\u201cTt was hard graft, but excellent grounding. Whilst no two deals were the same, the Credo's for \ness Dan teaches never change. For anyone interested in super success, I recommend Dan's training \nxclusively. Few individuals come close to his attitude or knowledge in business. Classic comments like, \nsuccess is not for everyone\u2019 and \u2018if you want a friend, buy a dog,\u2019 are very unlike those happy-clappy \ngood seminars. More important, they re-enforce the fact that without a serious \u2018pay price to action\u2019, \nWithout grit and passion, in his words, you can forget about it!\u201d \n\n\nelling the Seller on You \n\n\nMost business owners, particularly those who have founded and grown their company from \nsh, are very protective about their firm.

That's fine. But I give you these \nalternative strategies because business is hardball": null, " and if you're more comfortable pitching softballs, \nsomebody, sometime, is going to knock your butt right out of the park! \n\n\nSpeaking of hardball, I tell my seminar attendees that in any deal there's a high road... and a low \ntoad.

Of course you always want to avoid litigation. \nIt\u2019s costly and it takes your focus off your real priorities. But if the other party even mentions litigation, sue \nthe bastard. Never threaten to sue. Sue! That's because you want to be the plaintiff. The plaintiff gets two \nts at the jury - and picks the venue for the civil trial. How do I know?

These are vital issues because existing customers look for continuity. \n\n\nThe fact is - everybody wants continuity. Especially you. Continuity of operations, and the stren| \nof that continuity to generate increasing profits, is what you're buying. A Quantum Leap is actually a di \nleap from zero to full profit-making capacity, giving you the opportunity to skip all the growing pains in \nbetween.

This gives me a different perspective of the same target. And I can compare what the finance man \n\n\nto build my picture of the company. \n\n\nFinally, I try to invite the marketing and sales people, always a gregarious bunch, out for a few \nafter work - on me, of course. After a few rounds we're all asshole buddies, and they do what drunken \nemployees do best - bitch about the company. This is invariably the most instructive meeting of all. \n\n\nYou want to acquire a company with a broad customer base. The last thing you need after you sit \nn in your new corner office is to get a call from the customer who represents 40% of your billings saying, \nWe've decided to move our business down the street.\u201d The largest customer of any company you consider \nshould account for no more than 15% of total billings. Part of your preparatory work should even include a \nchat with the largest four or five customers, to see how they feel about dealing with a new owner. If less than \n0 or 30 customers are involved, you may want to see all of them. \n\n\nI buy and operate companies wherever I find them. So fly hell ofa lot. But I don't mind, because \n\n\nly business life has always necessitated travel and my procedures are geared to working on planes, in hotel \nfooms and by e-mail. \n\n\nOne day you may feel as comfortable with out-of-town or out-of-state business ownership as I \nBut right now your first acquisition should be local if possible. Otherwise, when the inevitable problems \nse, commuting back and forth will become a colossal pain in the butt. If you have a family, and want to \n\nthem, it's even worse. Staying local not only means less traveling, it also puts you into a business where \n\n\neady know the market, you may already know some of the customers, and where you're established \nthe business community. \n\n\nFinding the best possible acquisition target is not easy. Unless you happen to know somebody \nlows anybody trying to sell exactly what you want to buy, or beginner's luck turns up a gem, you can \nour acquisition search to take six months or more. Even if you find your dream company the second \nstill need to validate it by looking for a lot of other companies. This process is important, because \ninate half of your problems when you select and go after a qualified target. But remember... the deal \nhot- or it\u2019s not. Period! You still have to investigate even the hottest deal. \n\n\n\n\n\ni": "www.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nIUHT First \u0430\u0443\u0443 \u043a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np? When you're satisfied with your investigations, and the deal looks good on paper and feels hot, it's \ntime to tie up and move to closure. I use a letter of intent which spells out the specifics and gives me an option \nto buy at a certain price. My letter of intent concludes with a sense of urgency, saying, in effect, \u2018Please let \nus know as soon as possible (or by such-and-such date), so if you do not intend to act we can move on to our \nnext choice.\" \n\n\nI don't use contracts, because a letter of intent is just as effective and less intimidating to the \nprospect. At the same time, I have begun to search for my funding, since I intend, as always, to use Other \nPeople's Money. \n\n\nLet's buy a hypothetical company. We'll call it Rufus Electronics. My acquisition audit tells me \nthis company is worth $10 million. I tell Mister Rufus, who is looking forward to retirement, that I can pay \nhim $9 million cash. After some requisite hesitation, he accepts my offer. \n\n\nNow all I need is $9 million. But I have it all worked out. Rufus Electronics has shown a fairly \nsteady three-year cash flow of almost $90,000 a month. That figure supports a $60,000 per month debt, based \non the \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430 rule-of-thumb that cash flow should be about 1.5 times debt service. Since current cash flow \ndetermines debt level, my banker has determined Rufus Electronics can support roughly a $720,000 annual \ndebt service. At 1096 of total debt, this figure in turn supports approximately a $7 million dollar non-equity \nloan. And as always to preclude escalating debt service, I try to borrow at a fixed rate. \n\n\nA good rule to remember is that if cash flow will not service the debt, you re paying too much! \nOf course, there are exceptions, i.e., a company that is /osing money. But I really want to purchase Rufus \nElectronics, and to demonstrate how to make that purchase without using my own money. \n\n\nSo all I need is $2 million to cover the shortfall. What are my options? \n\n\n1) Old man Rufus takes back $2 million in paper, a promissory note to pay him in monthly \ninstallments for a predetermined number of years. \n\n\n2) I generously make Mister Rufus a part of the Dream with 1296, 1596 or even 1994 of the \ncompany still his, based on my accountant's recommendation. I give him an office and an emeritus title, | \nand the reassurance that when I sell his former company he shares in the profit, which might be even \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435 | \nthan a paltry two million. This option is especially attractive for the Rufus mooch heirs. \n\n\n3) I find an equity player, a venture capitalist who'll give me $2 million in return for maybe \n30-40% equity in the company. In fact, the capital needed might be $2.2 million - $2.4 million to cover all \nfees and professional expenses and in many instances a coupon at some fixed rate will have to be paid on \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nMapa ka ~ LAMM ~ \u0430\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0435: UJ NIHUTILUTTE TUWIN \n\n\ndg \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe equity portion of the purchase.

Casey, who passed away in 2008, was an energetic, ambitious guy from \n\n\n[B \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHanford, California, near Fresno.

Everybody thought he \n\n\nwas crazy. \n\n\nThe owner didn't want to sell. He didn't even care for Casey as an individual. Casey remembered \nthat Dan Pe\u00f1a says, \u2018No means yes, 'so he approached the country's largest jewelry store acquisition company \n- and they tried going behind his back to buy it for themselves! \n\n\n\n\n\nCasey wanted that store. So he finally made the owner an offer he couldn't refuse. In addition to \nthe purchase price, the guy would receive 50% of all profits during the first 90 days after the acquisition, when \nthey would liquidate the assets. He made the seller a generous part of the transaction...soothed his pride with | \nmoney...and the deal went through. \n\n\nCasey later wrote, \u201cIn following the same steps Dan Pe\u00f1a did when he was acquiring multi- \nmillion-dollar companies, I was able to: purchase the oldest jewelry store in the state of California in just | \nthree months after attending Dan 5 seminar, battling against the biggest jewelry store acquisition company \nin the US", " and without using any of my own money or taking on debt.

A good idea is to give the fir \u0456 \ncompany about three years of operation after your acquisition, so you and your \u201cCee-pee-a\u201d can make a qualified \njudgment about its long-term health.

Fortunately, I\u2019ve never used that strategy nor talked \nto anyone who did. I'm far more familiar with the latter - selling. And I can give you some pointers on how \nto \u201cpuff up the hog\" ready for the fair, and get it ready to bring you top dollar. \n\n\nOwners sell their companies for several reasons. Some are simply ready to retire, take the cash \nand enjoy a more leisurely life. Others want an injection of capital to continue to grow their company, or an \naffiliation with a larger company for greater distribution, marketing or manufacturing resources. The best \nreason I can think of to sell a company is to free up assets and turn equity into cash. Lots of cash! \n\n\nSelling is the natural end of a cycle that began when you decided, years ago, to begin or acquire \nyour first company and make your Quantum Leap. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're young and energetic enough - and most of us are - you can take part of your newly | \nliquefied assets or the leverage it provides and acquire a second or even third company, and start the process \nover again. One thing I learned quickly - making an enormous amount of money suddenly, from a single \ntransaction, is habit-forming. Absolutely erotic! You're 18 again \u2014 and you can't get enough. The more you \ndo it, the more you want to! \n\n\nPay Yourself First! \n\n\nBefore we get into the specifics of implementing your exit strategy, let's talk about paying yourself \nand your people. A company owner whose aim is to grow the company arithmetically will characteristically \nplow profits back into the company to strengthen its financial profile, to purchase new equipment or expand \n\n\nhowever necessary. \n\n\nI can't emphasize enough that you as a company owner need to pull money out of the company 10 \npay yourself, so you can begin to enjoy the lifestyle that you and your family have earned. Many owners feel \nguilty about rewarding themselves, as if they're betraying the company. That mentality is fine if you never \nintend to sell. But if you do plan to sell - as I hope you do - you'll fell less obligated to squeeze every penn! \nout of the deal if you've been paying yourself all along. \n\n\nWhile you're paying people, never forget the employees who have made your company success \nenough to become a marketable item.

They need a bonus now \nand then - especially at Christmas or end-of-year - which confirms their value to the company. \n\n\nli \n\n\nSo take money out and put it aside for you and your employees so you can pay deserved bonuses \nin all business conditions and cycles. When you borrow money, borrow enough to tuck away for employee \nbonuses. Don't make yourself wait, and don't make your people wait for the rewards they deserve. The clich\u00e9 \nis true - take care of your people, and they'll take care of you. \n\n\nThe market - not you - will determine how much you will ultimately get for your company. The \nfair market value is what your company, or any commodity, can bring in open exchange between a buyer and \na seller in an uncontrolled market environment. You should bring in professionals to perform valuations so \nyou have at least a ball-park estimate of how much to ask. \n\n\nBe assured that any serious buyer will conduct his own valuations, because nobody believes \n\n\nRegardless of who does it, there are four universally accepted means of valuing a company - plus \none which is all too often used by business owners: \n\n\n\n\n\n1) The Asset Approach based on fair market values ~ This method adds up the fair \nmarket values of company assets, after netting out the total of the firm's tangible liabilities. A real estate \nholding company might use this approach. Quite often a company in financial trouble will do an asset- \nbased valuation just before a \u201cgoing-out-of-business\u201d liquidation sale. This type of evaluation would be \nappropriate for an outdated manufacturing plant sitting on a valuable piece of property. \n\n\n2) The Income Capitalization Approach - This valuation method, also called discounted \n\n\nvalue of future cash flow, is based on the current worth of economic benefits that will be enjoyed by the \nbuyer in the future. It tracks the company's expected future earnings stream over a predetermined payback \nperiod, expressed in present value dollars. This method is filled with \u201ciffies,\u201d because who can predict \n3 interest rates, inflation, or hypothetical future revenues and expenses? Nevertheless, most prospective \nbuyers want to use this approach to assess your company's value, since it stresses future performance. \n(Buyers will typically pay three to five times annual cash flow, all others factors being equal.) Accordingly, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif you use the same type of valuation, you get a clearer idea in advance of how much a prospect may be ^ \nwilling to pay. \n\n\n3) The Market Comparison Approach - This method is similar to that used in the real estate \n\n\nmarket, comparing the financial performance and ratios of similar companies, i.e., return on assets, debt- \nto-equity ratios, return on sales rations, return on equity and price/earning (P/E). Average industry ratios | \nare published by Dun & Bradstreet, and by the US Bureau of Census in their Quarterly Financial Report | \nfor Manufacturing, Mining and Trade Corporations. The P/E ratio is perhaps the most widely used | \nmeasure of comparison, since it provides the most accurate reflection of a company's earning power and ` \ngrowth possibilities. It expresses a company's value as a multiple of net earnings after taxes. The higher. \nthis key ratio, the higher is the firm's growth potential. \n\n\n4) The Gross Revenues Approach - This method is for companies like the ones I like to run, \nThey gush torrents of income and matching expenses, with few if any retained earnings. In most cases they. \nhave few assets and little capital investment. Examples of these a re consulting firms, retail companies, \nradio stations, employment agencies, dealerships, professional service businesses, and public relations and | \n\n\nadvertising agencies. A specific company's value is expressed as a multiple of annual gross revenues. \n\n\nThe multiple is based on such factors as the company's reputation, time in business, sales record. \nand the strength of its industry. Multiples are very subjective, and are based as much on educated guesswork \nas industry figures. This is the best way to value a company which is referred to as a \u201ccash cow\", a company \nwhich only requires the buyer to survive and keep quiet to make money on his investment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5) The *Here's How Much I Want, Take It or Leave It\u2019 Approach - Some business owne! \n\n\nespecially those who have developed a deep emotional attachment to their company over the years - or who \nhave specific cash needs - will begin their valuation, not from the worth of their company, but from tht \namount of money they want or need out of the company. Unfortunately for them, companies are value \non their respective strengths and weaknesses - not on the personal desires or agendas of the owner. \n\n\nPuffing Up the Hog to Take to the Fair \n\n\n\u201cPuffing the show hog\" is no idle phrase, as any former 4-H kid will tell you.

Concurrently, your specific industry may \nin an upswing or downswing. The mid-nineties, for example, saw such industries as computer technology, \n'communications and health care sweep like tidal waves into the hearts of investors. Others, which cater for \nly stable wants and needs, hardly feel the bumps and dips. Add to these variables the condition of your \nn company, and its profit picture over the past three years. You're hardly in a position to demand top dollar \nif your revenues over the past few years have been flaccid.

Period! \n\n\nThe snapshot of your company on any given day - its financials, its contracts, even its physical \nition - is not the picture you want to present to potential buyers. \n\n\nWhen a potential buyer strolls through your premises, the most insignificant images stick in the \nlind - the receptionist's greeting, the clutter in the stockroom, dirty carpets, the crowd in the lounge, the \n'ards on the walls, the demeanor and noise level of employees. \n\n\nRemember - whether a person is buying a car, a house or a business, much of the decision is \nnally based.

This is \n\n\ncalled puffery! \nShoring Up Your Organizational Structure \n\n\nHousekeeping at the most elementary level requires that you update - or create - salary guidelines, \nboard meeting minutes, job descriptions. In fact, even the smallest company needs a policy and procedures \nmanual for employees, covering hours, vacations, health insurance, retirement plans and record keeping \nprocedures. An organizational chart, complete with titles and lines of accountability, will convey a sense of \norganization, and suggest that you as a CEO are already grooming others for senior executive positions. \n\n\nA Credible Board of Directors \n\n\nAnother preparatory step is one we've discussed relating to establishing your company in the \nfinancial community, that of assembling a distinguished board of directors (in some parts of the world, these \nare called Advisory Boards). Just as a list of respected executives on your board impresses a banker, it also \nspeaks volumes to potential buyers. Recruit them carefully, person by person, as if you were putting together a \nteam of all-stars. Offer them free stock, or options and warrants, to compensate them for the use of their name \nand the time they may spend advising you and your successor. Far beyond window dressing, in fact, your \nboard can provide you, and your potential buyer, with a wealth of business acumen and wisdom well worth \npurchasing. And remember, as I say in my seminars: \u201c J bought my first dream-team board of directors.\u201d \n\n\nCorporate Literature \n\n\nYour company also needs some literature to add to its legitimacy. A brochure tells prospective \nbuyers, as well as clients, of course, that the company is prosperous and aggressive in its marketing program. \nBrochures for high-tech firms are especially effective in explaining what the company does in pedestrian | \nlanguage. An illustrated color brochure will add pizzazz to the most seemingly mundane or complex | \nbusinesses. _ \n\n\n\n\n\nClean Financials \n\n\nClean up your financials too. I\u2019m sure you wouldn't do this, but a lot of companies use \"tax \navoidance strategies,\" such as excessive compensation, to camouflage earnings from the tax authorities. Such | \ntactics may well have a negative impact on a potential buyer who says to himself, \"Hmmm... what else are \nthese guys hiding?\u2019 But beyond ethical issues, buyers will typically only recognize your traceable profits. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(190) \n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nChapter 12 * Your Grand Exit - Dying or Selling \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0415 They're not going to pay for earnings that are invisible or not clearly documented, no matter how blatantly \n| you nudge and wink... \n\nIn order to avoid getting caught between the tax authorities and the concerns of a potential buyer, \nI suggest that in anticipation of putting your company on the market that you \"invest in taxes\" for a couple of \nyears. Yeah, when all else fails, pay your taxes. Just keep in mind that your company will be acquired based \n_ on multiples of earnings, so your investment in one or two years of taxes should bring you multiples of that \n| amount when you sell. \n\n\nWe'vetalked about audited financials. Such a report issued under the logo ofa respected accounting \nfirm will lend credibility to your company. This is another reason to \u201cget honest\" on your tax avoidance \n| schemes, since a reputable national CPA firm will \u201ctsk-tsk\u201d you for these practices. As you'll recall, these \neye-shaded bean counters are really trained to work for the tax-man and against you unless you can convince \n| them otherwise. \n\n\nDuring the normal course of business, you may have gotten a little loose in collecting your \nreceivables and tightening up your inventory. Uncollected receivables that you'll never collect should be \nmarked down, as should those dated and cobwebbed items in inventory that you'll never sell. \n\n\nSure as hell, a prospective buyer will dispatch his auditor to find these untidy holdovers. So you \nfind them first, and write them off. None of my companies will ever enter into an acquisition without an \nacquisition audit by a Big Four firm. \n\n\n\u2018Stable, Long-Term Contracts \n\n\nAnother clean-up chore is to strengthen and lengthen contractual agreements. Any potential \nhaser wants to buy into the same pattern of arrangements which have helped make you successful. These \nangements include any property and equipment leasing contracts, and, in a union environment, any labor \ncontracts. If you\u2019re anticipating selling, negotiate ahead of time a long-term labor contract that subsequently \nives any buyer a sense of stability with regard to his union workers. Although this isn't always possible, it \ndefinitely worth trying. \n\n\nCustomer contracts are equally important. When we were negotiating to purchase Bow Valley \nUSA, we looked carefully at the extensive coal contracts the company had with utility companies all over \n\n\nNorth America. Those contracts were part of the firm\u2019s assets as surely as were its coal mines. \n\n\nAlso solidify any contracts you have with suppliers, to provide you with raw materials or other | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million. \n\n\n\n\n\nE \n\n\nproducts at a certain price for a number of years. The more contracts you nail down, with every party, the \nmore stability you craft into a promising deal for a likely buyer. \n\n\nCleaning Up Your Paperwork \n\n\nIf you're like most owners of private companies, operating outside the public spotlight and SEC \ndisciplines, you've got a hell of a lot more to do than keep clean, timely records - like run the damn company! \nThat's fine if you never intend to sell. Otherwise, it's in your best interest to maintain all the data a prospective \nbuyer looks for as evidence of an organized and efficiently run operation. For example: \n\n* Payroll records \n\n* Tax records, reflecting up-to-date filings \n\n\u2022 Documentation of any bank loans \n\n\u2022 Documentation of copyrights, trademarks or patents. \n\n* Copies of current licensing, distribution or franchise agreements \n\n* \u0410\u041f documentation required by OSHA, the EPA and other bureaucratic tentacles of \n\n\ngovernment. \n\n\nSpeaking of the Environmental Protection Agency, make sure your company is in compliance with \nany appropriate environmental regulations and guidelines. Hire an outside evaluator to check your procedures \nand processes for dealing with handling and disposal of any waste your company may be generating. And \ndocument everything. \n\n\nInformation and Financial Control Systems \n\n\nBuyers who see a working system of controls in place are more likely to pay a premium for the \ncompany. They know that your systems will save them the agony of having to install these processes at \u00e0 \ntime they're going through post-acquisition transition. I suggest you have your accountants or an external \nconsultant review your controls and data processing systems to ensure they meet your needs. The cost of this \nreview will be more than recouped in the price paid by a satisfied buyer. \n\n\nThe Transition Management Team \n\n\nBuyers want assurance that you're not going to hand them the key at closing and disappear, along \nwith all the expertise which has made your company successful.

This is a vehicle that has been popular \nwith qualifying companies since the Tax Reform Act of 1986. It gives companies the protection and structure \nofa corporation, but the tax treatment of a partnership. An S Corporation sells assets, passes the gain or loss \nto individual shareholders who are then taxed at their individual rates. There are no corporate taxes. \n\n\nThe law stipulates that to qualify as an S Corporation, your firm must have only individuals as \nshareholders - not investment groups, for example - only one kind of stock, and no more then 35 shareholders. \nBefore you think about converting your existing company to an S Corporation, bear in mind that the IRS \nsays you can't sell or liquidate within ten years of your conversion. If so, you'll be taxed like a regular \ncorporation. \n\n\nIn summary, the time to begin thinking about your exit strategy is at the beginning of your \nentrepreneurial experience. From the first day you open your doors, keep full records and documentation, \nmaintain written policies and procedures, and regardless of how much of a pain it is, operate as if you were \nplanning to sell in three months. \n\n\nWatch and learn to anticipate economic and industry trends and cycles. Keep an eye on what \ncompanies comparable to yours are selling for. The whole time you're in business, you'll be preparing to \nexit on your terms. And, should a buyer happen to appear in your lobby unexpectedly some morning, you \nwon't have to scramble around at a disadvantage that could cost you hundreds of thousands, maybe millions \nin purchase price. \n\n\nFinally, whether you're just starting out or you're already in business, think of your dream company \nas a stepping stone, not as the end product of your dreaming. You can grow and nurture it, but never develop \nsuch an attachment that you cannot bear to sell it some day, regardless of your best interests. \n\n\nHigh performers regard companies as a means to a greater end, that being enormous wealth and \ntotal independence to pursue further goals in life. Your Quantum Leap will have already propelled you \nfurther than most people dare to dream. And put you at the starting mark for a /ifetime of Quantum Leaps! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(asa) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\npier AU ": "sune sitnu LUE 7 UF \u0438\u0447\u0441\u0435, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Thirteen \nTake Action Now! - or Never \n\n\n\u201cIf you dont take action to begin your Quantum Leap \nwithin 21 hours after finishing this book, you never will!\" \n\n\nIf you've read me this far, you've had a damn good *dose of Dan\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe talked about creating your personal foundation for success by thinking yourself out of the box \nof conventional wisdom.

Yet the methodologies of QLA work in that business \nenvironment as they do in every other industry. j \n\n\nDoris Primicerio has been operating telephone call centers for more than 36 years, starting in the \nbusiness at age 16. She started her own call center 22 years ago. Her niche is the telephone answering service \u0440 \nthat handles after-hour calls to and from hospitals and doctors. Her employees \u0430\u0433\u0435 trained to take all type \nof medical emergency call and speak knowledgably with callers to reassure them in a time of urgency. \u041d\u0435\u0433 \nbusiness was moderately successful when she heard me speak at the Hyatt International Airport in Orlando \n\n\nin 1995, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI challenged her to expand her business exponentially by buying and merging with other call \ncenter operations around the country. In recent years, Doris has done just that, purchasing and consolidating \nthose acquisitions at her Orlando, Florida, headquarters. In fact, less than a year ago, she went international, \nwith a call center in the Philippines employing some 50 agents. In the meantime, she fulfilled one of her | \nlong-time dreams by attending a Castle Seminar in early 2008. i \n\n\n\u201cI love Dan's Pe\u00edia-isms,\" Doris said recently. \u201cOne of my favorites is \"investigate before you \ninvest\" That one has save me thousands of dollars in purchasing companies that were not as stable of \nforthright in their reporting as they seemed on the surface. \n\n\n\u201cNot long ago, I challenged my son Jered to memorize the first 21 Pefia-isms. What I didn't tell \nhim was that I would pay him $1000 for every Pefia-ism he memorized. He learned 15, and kicked himse \nwhen I gave him $15,000 instead of the $21,000 he could have earned. Pe\u00f1a-isms are that important to me \nand I want them to be important in his business and personal life as well.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\"My only regret is that I waited 13 years to attend the Castle. I put it on my goal list back in 1995. \n\n\n\n\n\nth \n\n\n\n\n\n(202 \n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTf you are thinking about it or have it on your goal list, don\u2019t hesitate. Go to the Castle and listen to what Dan \nPefia, who I call the $400 million man, has to say. The entire Castle experience was absolutely incredible.\" \n\n\nOne of the best testimonies I've ever received came from a world-class professional in the field \nin which I am only beginning. I previously mentioned Ted Nicholas, one of the few other seminar lecturers \nactive today beside Dan \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430 that I'd recommend hearing. Ted, who spent a week with me in Scotland during \n\n\n\u201cI think this is the greatest seminar I have ever attended. This information is worth millions of \ndollars in the right hands. You could go to Harvard or Stanford and never get the practical, hard-hitting \ninformation Dan presented this week. It\u2019s often said that if you get one good idea from a seminar, it\u2019s time \nwell spent. I\u2019ve counted 103 specific notes of ideas I\u2019ve gotten from this seminar, and I plan to use them \nin my activities,\u201d \n\n\nI\u2019ve alluded to one of my current entrepreneurial partners, Peter Sage, several times. I\u2019ve saved \nhis story for last because just as many of those I quote here represent how far QLA has come, Peter\u2019s vision \nlaunches us into the future \u2014 and off the planet! \n\n\nPeter is the co-founder of Space Energy, Inc., an international corporation pursuing a project to \nbuild and launch the world\u2019s first commercially viable space-based solar power satellite systems. Imagine \na network of huge satellites in geosynchronous orbit some 22,500 miles above earth. What a vision \u2014 \u201cto \nenable environmentally clean and sustainable energy \u2014 electricity \u2014 to be safely broadcast to earth 24 hours a \nday from space with zero pollution!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDan is my mentor on this project,\u201d wrote Peter recently. \u201cBy the end of 2008, we were putting \nour dream team together to pitch for the big money at the best commercial terms.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s funny, \nyears ago when I first heard Dan use the term \u2018your first hundred million,\u2019 I thought, wow, I need to up my \n\u0435. I now find myself putting together a $15 billion project that can change history and I finally understand \nWhat he meant.\u201d \n\n\nAmericans tend to think myopically of high-priced energy and dwindling sources in terms of \u201cgas \nPrices at the pump.\u201d But meeting global demands must include satisfying the growing need for energy in \n+h burgeoning nations as India and China. China alone, with 1.3 billion customers, is opening a coal-fired \nWer plant every week for the next ten years! The energy needs for these two emerging giants alone cannot \net with currently available energy resources. In addition, the continuing use of fossil fuels such as coal \nleases more and more CO?, SO?, NOx and other harmful emissions into our fragile atmosphere. \n\n\nThe space solar power satellite program is ambitious, ballsy and supported by leading aerospace \nh organizations. Design, launch and operational technology exist. And Peter has incorporated \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour First 100 Mullion \n\n\n\n\n\nc eem Leap thinking into bringing the vision of clean and cheap energy, as infinite as the sun, into \u0437\u043e\u043c \nreality in a few short years. \n\nHow many ways and through how may people can I say it? This stuff works. And after you laser- \nfocus on your vision, ignite your passions, and practice your success, and then you land on your feet after \nyour first Quantum Leap, you'll want to do it again. You'll look at your bank account, suddenly the size of the \nMatterhorn, and say, \u201cHey, Dan, that was fun.\" Yes I know. I'm still making my own leaps - for the love and \nthe money of it. It sure beats business as usual for the rest of your life! And if you don't make $20 million... \nif you aim for $20 million and only make $7 million - so what? \n\n\nI look for deals everywhere. At my seminars, where 400 people \u043e\u0433 more may attend, I conclude \nmy lectures with an invitation. I tell my audience of established business owners, entry level entrepreneurs \nand \u201cwannabes\u201d that if they have a project, a deal they think I might be interested in, fax me a one-page \nmemo. Not two pages or one page-and-a-word, just one, single page. I can read that page, and tell if it\u2019s hot, \nor just a mush-brained fantasy. If it is hot, I can determine in a heartbeat what it needs to take off, to become \na multi-million dollar Quantum Leap. 1 extend this offer only to those who have attended my Quantum Leap. \nAdvantage seminars, and we have hit it off and discover a certain level of chemistry! Think about it. J can \nbe your mentor! \n\n\n\n\n\nI almost never put my own money into a deal. Instead, the bearer of a deal he or she believes is hot. | \ncan approach me in one of two ways. We can enter into a formal mentor/mentee relationship wherein I get at \nleast 25% in direct equity or options of the deal, plus a monthly retainer\u2019s fee, plus other expenses. (After 15 \nyears of dealing with mentees and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, I know too well that advice, even from me, that costs nothing is \nvery often not followed. Remember \u201c\u0440\u0430\u0443 price to action?\" And in the end, I am stuck with a minority interest \nin a privately held company with no exit.). \u201cDan, you'd take 25% or more of my dream?\" Damn right! \nWhich would you rather have? Seventy-five percent of several million I can pump your hog up to - or 100% | \nof nothing? The choice is yours. \n\n\nIf you're so proud or so sure of your deal that you want to hold 100% of equity, you can hire me \u2014 \nand my nearly four decades of experience on an hourly or daily rate, plus expenses. But be forewarned \u2014 nj \ndon't come cheap. \n\n\nMy Final Words \nIf you've stuck with me this far, you've passed a doofus test of your own. You're probably 2 \n\n\nserious individual, scratching and clawing your way towards a dream that you may have seemed further away \nthis morning than it did yesterday.

As I\u2019ve often said, this is my definition of insanity. You've got a good \n| business that's getting by paying the bills. You're on the cusp of giving birth to a new venture, but just can't \n| get her going. Or you've got a hell of an idea, one you've been tweaking for years, one every expert says will \nmake you rich and famous... but after all this time, it's still just an idea. \n\n\nOther people are doing it. You know something's missing in your formula. Maybe that's why \n| you go to all those seminars and buy those books and tapes at the tables in the back. So what the hell's the \nanswer? \n\n\nThad a guy who filled out a critique sheet at the end of a recent seminar, and it was like to light of \n| knowledge had just burned right through his eyeballs into his brain. T\u2019ve been looking for the secret to raising \nmoney and building my super success. I found out the secret today. There is no secret! Dan Pe\u00f1a explains why \npeople who I'd never suspect of financial acumen... are out there building monster companies and monster \ndeals, while I'm on the sideline trying to figure out how they did it. Now I know.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now you know. And you have no one to blame but yourself if you don't make it happen. \n\n\nAction really is the key to making it big in this world littered with lay-abouts and armchair \n\n\ndreamers. Anyone can say they want super-success. Anyone can set goals for super-success. Anyone can \ndream of super-success.

Deploy \nyour assets where they have the greatest probability of achieving geometric success - in areas that you know \nwell and/or in areas your team knows well. \n\n\nStay laser-beam focused.

Start with verifying what you know. \n\n\nName of person \n\nAddress \n\nPhysical description of person \nAge - approximate \nOccupation \n\nName of company \n\n\nVoter\"s Records \n\nThe County Registrar of Voters (the number will be in the phone book) will usually verify if a \nperson is registered to vote and often will confirm a complete name, address, and date of birth. In the UK, \nconsult the Electoral Roll. \n\n\nLawsuits \nCheck the county in which the person lives and/or works for lawsuits. \nLook in the phone book, under the county name, for the Court Clerk. Call and say you want to \nfind out if someone is involved in a lawsuit. They'll tell you how to do it, either over the phone, by mail, or \n\n\nin person. \n\n\nLawsuits are usually filed at the county level, not the state. But each state can be organized \ndifferently, so ask questions. \n\n\nFederal Courts are organized by jurisdictions which include several counties. Look in the phone \nbook under U.S. Government and find the listing for District Court. Call and ask how to go about it. Often \nthis must be done by mail for a $15 search fee. \n\n\nCriminal Convicti \nBasically the same steps as for lawsuits. Look for Criminal Court listing. \nUsually you can get criminal conviction information, but this doesn\u2019t include arrest informati: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nion. \nThis can be done at the county and federal level.

They will tell you the date a company was \nincorporated, if they are incorporated. Also ask for the names of officers and directors. In the U.K., Companies \nHouse will provide all of this information. \n\n\nA company might not be a corporation but a \u201cDoing Business As\" \u2014 dba -, or a fictitious business \nname. This is usually filed at the county level. Check the phone book under county name. Some counties \nrequire business licenses. Check the phone book for the county in question. \n\n\nLibraries are tremendous source of information. Contact the Reference Librarian and explain \nyour inquiry. She will either tell you how to go about searching, or do it for you. Ask to review any newspaper/ \nprint media microfiche for information. If you subscribe to a cutting service, use their facilities to search. \nAlso, try a Google search. It\u2019s amazing what a good search engine will turn up on the Internet! \n\n\nThere are also a number of business directories. For example, the Standard and Poors directory \ngives business summaries of many companies. There are also directories which list company executives. \n\n\nSpecial Licensing \n\nIf the person purports to have a license, such as a real estate agent/broker, lawyer, or building \ncontractor, this can usually be checked at the state level. Call the state information operator and ask who you \ncontact to verify the license in question. \n\n\nSchools \n\n\nIf someone says they\u2019re a graduate of a school, call the Administration Department of that school \nand ask for school records. They will usually tell you if someone graduated and what degree they earned. \n\n\nProperty \nThe County Tax Assessor\u2019s records will confirm if someone owns real property. \n\n\nGrantee/Grantor Records \nCounties usually have a Hall of Records where they file Tax Liens (county, state and federal), \n\n\n| Property deeds, and mortgages (including second mortgages). Check the phone book for the number, call \n\n\nand ask how to do it. Usually one must go in and search in person, or they may search some records over the \nphone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 1UU Mution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix D \nWords to Help You Make Your Millions \n\n\nPefia-isms \nThe world's greatest teachers are able to boil down pages of text and hours of oratory into a \npithy phrase or quick parable.

When you deal with the opinionated or egotistical, always give credit where it isn't due. \n\n4, Business deals start and end with people - the interaction of flesh and blood, bone and sinew, \nheart and mind, emotion and soul. \n\n5. Dream big... think big. be big. \n\n5. Dream big... and dare to fail! \n\n5. The more you investigate, the less you have to invest. \n\n5. Never, ever second-guess yourself. \n\n5. Cash only prolongs death. It doesn't avoid it. \n\n5. I\u2019ve never seen a \"part-time\" super successful, high performance person. \n\n5. A deal has to sound good before it is good. \n\n6. During Quantum growth, any problem you solve will be replaced immediately by a larger, \nmore complicated problem. \n\n7. Every party to every negotiation has a comfort zone. The effective negotiator is the one who \ncan define the boundaries of the other party's comfort zone, then place the deal inside the boundary of that \nzone nearest his own interests. \n\n8.

The difference between a failure and a high performance individual is how each deals with \nfear. We are all afraid. A high performance person uses his fear to galvanize his actions. \n\n30. Ignorance is a steep hill with jagged rocks at the bottom. \n\n31. The only difference between a champ and a chump is \u201cU\u201d. \n\n32. To succeed in business you must do more than take a step in the right direction. You have \ntotakea Quantum Leap. \n\n33. A good plan executed today is better than a great plan executed next week. \n\n34. In order to really succeed in business, you must have outside advisors. These must be trusted \nadvisors, professionals at your accounting and law firms with whom you have a very special relationship. \nThese advisors become your moles within their own organization, more loyal to you than their employer... \nmotivated, aggressive, ambitious and bright enough - but not as bright as he or she thinks. \n\n35. You can't win at poker or business with scared money. It gives offa stench that is repugnant \nto the other side. If you're going to play, leave your money at home and play with OPM - Other People\u2019s \nMoney. \n\n36. The fulfillment of your dream is dire&tly proportional to your desire to succeed... and how \nmuch you're willing to sacrifice. /f you are not prepared to die, then you are not prepared to live. \n\n37. When you get rid of someone, never give them a \u201chook\u201d with which to get back in. Always \nmake a clean, definable and irrevocable break. \n\n38. Quantum Leap success means fishing with nets, not just with lines. \n\n39. To achieve \u201chyper-growth\u201d, avert avoidable mistakes, and let your successes run their \ncourse. Do more of what you're doing right - and less of what you're doing wrong. \n\n41. You always need a reason to overlook the obvious. \n\n41. Never underestimate how wrong you can be. Even the most careful planning can be \novertaken by external events and circumstances. \n\n42. Always maintain your personal relationships on the same plane upon which they were \nformed. True friends will rejoice in your professional successes. Allow them to enjoy them with you. \nNever reassess their personal and professional lives in terms of your own. \n\n43. Your most valuable natural asset is your own gut instinct. Don't be afraid of it. Your \ninstinct has more power than all of the conventional wisdom in the world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ns) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\nE \n\n\n\n\n\n44. Business opportunities abound - but formidable barriers exist. And the biggest barrier is \npsychological. It is you. \n\n45. Your greatest idea, born out of revolutionary thinking and passion, will die of indifference, \napathy and the cancer of low expectations. \n\n46. Conventional wisdom is almost always wrong. \n\n47. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Just because something has never been \ndone doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done. The fact you have never seen or heard something is not proof that it \ndoesn\u2019t exist. \n\n48. Every worthy dream has a \u201cpay-price-to-action\u201d. That means you have to give up something \nto get something. You can\u2019t have it all. \n\n49, The old Kenny Rogers song, \u201cThe Gambler\u201d has a message for CEOs. \"You've got to \nknow when to hold \u2018em, and know when to fold \u2018em.\u201d As a CEO you'll get more advice from your staff \nthan you know what to do with. But it\u2019s up to you to know when to \u201chold \u201c\u0435\u0442\u201d and when to \u201cfold \u201c\u0435\u0448\u201d. \nListen to your staff. Listen to your gut. Make your decision and move on. \n\n50. I never met a super successful, high performance person who wasn't enthusiastic. \n\n51. The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself. \n\n53. A deal is either hot - or it's not. \n\n53. You don't have to know how you're going to get there. But you do need to know where \nyou want to go. \n\n54. If you have no destination, wherever you end up will be acceptable. \n\n55. It costs nothing to aim high - but if you aim at nothing, you'll hit anything. \n\n56. FEAR is... False Expectations Appearing Real. \n\n57. \u0441 \n\n58. \"Thinking it over\" is for people who can't take action. \n\n59. Quantum Growth eliminates clear sailing. So you'd better learn to navigate troubled \nwaters. \n\n60. From chaos comes order. In chaos is opportunity - Chaordic! \n\n61. Whoever said money can't buy you happiness doesn't know where to shop. \n\n62. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. \n\n63. More of the same usually just gives you more of the same. \n\n64. It doesn't matter what morons say. \n\n65. Give potential associates and partners the \u201cDoofus Test\". Place them under stress to see \nhow they react to pressure as a high performance person. \n\n66. You are paid in life not for what you know, but what you can do. Or get others to do. \n\n67. Ideas are a dime a dozen. The person who puts them into action is priceless. \n\n68. You've known all along it's tough to be successful. But you'd rather hear the fairy tales. \n\n70. Half-truths and misinformation sell easier - and return harder. \n\n70.

But no one ever asks, *How do we manage \nfailure?\u2019 \n\n72. Regret for the past is a waste of the spirit - and makes no money! \n\n73. Minutia never makes money. It only makes manure, \n\n74. Super successful people are macro managers who know that less control means more \ncontrol. \n\n75. Always respect the individual on the other side of the deal. He is not as stupid as you may \nthink. And you're not as smart as you think. \n\n76. Logic can be a logical process which leads to a wrong conclusion. \n\n77. Yt isn't a case of taking a big chance. It's a matter of giving yourself a big chance. \n\n78. The more self-esteem you give others, the more you have. And the more you have, the \neasier it is to give away. \n\n79. Most successful people do it poorly until they do it well. Just keep blundering along. You \ncan't wait until it's exactly right. The product of your quest for perfection is... paralysis. \n\n80. High performance people get paid for performing their hobbies. \n\n81. I may be wrong - but I\u2019m never in doubt! \n\n82. Don't hire credentials. Hire attitude. \n\n83. Surprise your associates - and your enemies. \n\n84. Structure follows strategy. If you base your strategy on your existing structure, you limit \nyour potential to what you've already done. \n\n86. Watch your peaks and troughs. As long as your lows are higher than before, your Quantum \nLeap Action War Plan is working. \n\n86. A guarantor is a fool with a pen. \n\n87. No matter how tempting, never accept short-term solutions to long-term problems. \n\n88. Too many companies try to patch when they should amputate. \u2018Let 5 reorganize and save \nthis mess\u2019 is \u0430 clarion call to disaster. Cut your losses, kick the cuttings out of your way, and move on. \n\n89. If you want to travel above and beyond the herd, don't try to be better. Try to be different. \nOr better yet, be first! \n\n90. Your doubts are not the product of accurate thinking, but habitual thinking. \n\n91. Find your passion and wrap your career around it. \n\n92. Live your life on purpose! \n\n93. You'll be motivated by inspiration... or desperation. It's your choice. \n\n94. People with low self-esteem protect themselves by not taking risks. High self-esteem \ngives you the power of confidence to take chances. \n\n95. Give yourself permission to make mistakes. It's called learning. \n\n96.

You cannot make a Quantum Leap if you don't share the wealth with your Dream Team \nand employees - be it cash, equity, options or warrants that are tangible rewards for performance and \nloyalty. \n\n101. Never, ever share your doubts with anyone. \n\n101. Being all you can be is possible for anyone, but... \n\n102. ... super success is not for everyone. Period. \n\n103. Fear of failure is caused by lack of self-esteem and confidence. Dealing with fear is the \nkey to super success. \n\n104. Don't take high performance advice from your peers, family or friends unless they are \nhigh performance people themselves. \n\n105. You cannot grow exponentially by yourself. You need the support of others. \n\n106. Don't set time limits for achieving goals. They should transcend time. \n\n107. Set goals you cannot achieve in your lifetime. \n\n108. Business should not run smoothly while you're making your Quantum Leap. Chaos is \nnormal. The business on quiet waters is still in the harbor. \n\n109. Life is what happens while you're making other plans. \n\n110. The road to success is always under construction. \n\n111. Get ruthless about trying something different. \n\n112.

As \nyou've been told, some 20 years ago, I too, graduated from this same school some 20 years ago. \n\n\nWhen first asked by Dean Hosek to be your commencement speaker, I was honored yet somewhat \nbewildered. What would I speak of, or about? How could I relate to students graduating two decades later? \n\n\nIn short, things have changed a great deal in the last 20 years. Yet they haven't. \n\n\nI was surprised to find that your average age is not much different from mine when I graduated in \n1971! I was surprised to find that most of you have had to work to put yourself through school, as I did. Most \nof you were born during the Vietnam War. My generation was born at the end of the Second World War. You \nare graduating at the end of the Persian Gulf War. I was graduated from college during the Vietnam War. You, \nas students, did the same things to get by as my generation did and the same that all generations of college \nand university graduating students have done since higher education became a necessity. \n\n\nWe have all wondered, did we take the right classes? Did we have the right minor? Should or \nshoulda\u2019 t we have changed our major? Should we have taken more statistics? And on and on! Students have \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| asked themselves these questions for generations! But the real quandary all graduating students have belies a \n| more in-depth theme. Will these years we've spent laboring for a piece of parchment really make a difference \nout there in the \u201creal world?\" Will we be happy? Will we make a contribution? Will we be satisfied? Will we \n| be content? Will we be successful? And for some of you, will we be rich and famous? \n\n\nI wish I could tell you that the School of Business Administration and Economics asked me to be \nits first commencement speaker because, as one of our own graduates, I have all these answers. \n\n\nBut that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. I can't give you any panaceas because there aren't any out there. \n\u2018Sadly, I do not possess this wisdom, but I do have acknowledge of accomplishing goals, against the odds. It \nds my enthusiasm I wish to share with you": null, " and that is why I am here today - to share with you my wisdom of \nWhat worked to be a success, not only in business, but in life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are certain proven guidelines that I believe can be enormously helpful if you choose to mse\") \nthem. They worked for me and there is no reason why they can\u2019t work for you. \n\n\nSome of them will be easy to comprehend. Some others will require a little more thought. And \nthen, my fellow graduates, there will be things I say that you will need a great deal of blind faith to follow. \nI have been exactly where you are now. This advice comes from my deepest convictions of what it takes to \nsurvive in the world of business today. \n\n\nMy speech this morning will treat the following points: \n\n\n(1) your college education and what you have really achieved": null, " \n\n(2) how business perceives recent graduates and what will be expected from you": null, " \n(3) how to use what you've learned to the utmost": null, " \n\n(4) how to acquire the knowledge you don't have yet": null, " \n\n(5) how to make what you've learned work for you": null, " and finally, \n\n(6) real life, concrete examples of what I\u2019m illustrating. \n\n\nAs many of you know, prior to attending CSUN I was raised and educated just a few miles from \nhere. When I started my education at CSUN in September 1963, I had no idea of what my future would be. \n\n\nMy idea of education was that it resulted in parties, drinking and basically outlandish behavior. \nHowever, my education was interrupted by the Vietnam War. I entered the Army in June 1966 and served for \n3+ years. During my time in the service, I went through OCS and was commissioned as a 2\u2122 Lieutenant. \n\n\nThere were many men who served under my command. Some were my age, but most were older. \nMy entire outlook on life changed during this period. 1 had responsibility not only for \u0442\u0443 well-being, but \nfor their well-being as well. It was at this time that I learned to value people's worth, their integrity, and their \nactions. Therefore, when I returned to CSUN in September 1969, I was no longer an inexperienced youth but \nsomeone who knew what he wanted from life. 1 came back with a vengeance, taking an average of 20 units \nper semester, with 15 units in summer school and graduated January 1971 on the Dean's List. And I thrived \non it. \n\n\nIsaw my professors as equals, men and women who were there to assist me with my goals. I took \nmany of the same classes as you did, and yes, some of the same professors. Shirley Teetor, Sol Buchalter, Joe \nBachwald and Fidal Zuwaylif remember me well! \n\n\nNow, let us look at what you have received from CSUN": null, " and more importantly, the advantages I \nbelieve you have over your competition from other recent university graduates. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na f$ \n\n\n(220) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nAppendices \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nig \n\n\nhave national recognition. You have had good-to-outstanding instruction in many subjects. Except for a few \nof the top business schools in the country, you will be perceived to be on equal, or better, footing than those \nwith whom you will be competing for jobs, or new positions within the company where you already work. \nAs your career unfolds, you will come to appreciate that you are definitely equal and usually superior to your \ncompetition. \n\n\nHowever, that realization of your ability will become evident only through time! \n\n\nThus far, we have established that you are intellectually equal to or slightly better than a majority \nof those you will be going head-to-head with in the real world. Some of your superiority has resulted from the \nfact you worked in business while attending CSUN, or you graduated with distinction - Bravo! But whatever \nthe reason for your business edge, take it and make it work for you. Remember, you only need a slight \nadvantage in life to be successful. A case in point is Las Vegas. There, too, you only need a slight edge! \n\n\nNow we will discuss what business expects from you. \n\n\nIt has been my experience that employees are expected to be competent in many tasks performed, \nand especially well-conversant in just a few! These few are the future roads to your eventual success! The few \n- not the many! Nobody expects you to be a whiz kid at everything you do, but most seasoned managers expect \nto promote people that excel at something in particular. That is not to say that being the best in statistics won't \nget you put into Personnel, but management looks for trends of excellence that they can fit into their corporate \nstructure. Into their corporate strategy - not yours! \n\n\nHow to achieve this level of excellence in a given endeavor is the question you must answer. \nCorporate America wants you to make their system better. It is not likely that you will devise a better system \nthan our forefathers, so stick with it and make it happen within the system. \n\n\nLet us examine what we have learned here at CSUN. Itis only now, twenty years later, that I \nappreciate why you are given a bit of many individual disciplines within the School of Business and Economics. \nAlbeit some of the courses are less than exciting. However, it is the exposure you need to be a least verbally \naware. You will find out that there is a great deal of \u201cOJT\u201d - On the Job Training! And from the dark recesses of \nyour brain, bits of knowledge will spring forth at the most advantageous times. It will become apparent to your \nemployer that you are a most valuable asset. \n\n\nFor example, you may have studied finance as your core discipline but there is potential opportunity \nin marketing. Because you have read much about marketing, you are not shut out or boxed early in your career. \n_ The bottom line - always be prepared to take opportunities where you find them! Be courageous. Take that \n\n\n\n\n\nYou are receiving your degree from a good school with a fine reputation. In certain disciplines \u0443\u0431] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n221) \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0430 lg \nchance! You will be rewarded. \n\n\nNow that you have mastered the preliminaries of getting ahead, let me focus on the hardest to \nfathom portion of your career path. You must not only keep abreast of everything in your area, but also in any \narea you feel might provide an opportunity to excel. Managers are aware that it takes time and a lot of effort to \nbe conversant in another area. And you may ask \n\n\n*Why is this the most difficult part of my career path?\" Well, ladies and gentlemen, this additional \neducation will be acquired while you are working. Most or all of your leisure time will be used for the purpose \nof educating yourself. Your formal education has ended, but your real education has just begun. \n\n\nSome people call this part of self growth the \"school of hard knocks\" but it doesn't have to be. There \nwill be disappointments, but if you keep up your perseverance, they should pale in comparison to your many \nsuccesses and accomplishments. The perseverance that I speak of is the same perseverance that each of you has \nexhibited, bringing you here to this moment today. And fellow business and economic graduates, that's what \nreally differentiates you from most of the working masses. You persevered in the good times, but especially in \nthe face of many adversities. We all know these adversities because we have shared them together. \n\n\nNow, for the last and probably hardest guideline to digest vis-\u00e0-vis turning your education into what \nyou want. On this point, I\u2019ve given a great deal of thought. I want to say the right things and yet I don't want to \nmake it sound so unrealistic that it becomes a self-fulfilling turnoff. Making a success out of yourself, whatever \nthat means to each and everyone of you, is about commitment - commitment to yourself and your loved ones! \nIt is about all the corny things that we have heard since we were children. \n\n\nIt is about great men and women since the beginning of time. People such as Joan of Arc, Abraham \nLincoln, Golda Meyer, Martin Luther King and Margaret Thatcher. All of these well-known men and women had \none thing in common. These were people who chose to be committed to a principle": null, " such as Abraham Lincoln - \nthe freeing of the slaves": null, " Golda Meyer - the bringing together of the Middle East with the newly formed nation \nof Israel": null, " Martin Luther King - equal rights for all": null, " and Margaret Thatcher - a new British economy. \n\n\nBut we don't have to look for examples of commitment on a national or world-wide basis. We can \nlook right here at CSUN and our own School of Business and Economics. We can look right here at this podium. \nPresident Cleary is a man of commitment. When I returned after my military service to CSUN in September \n1969, Dr. Cleary had just assumed his new position. I know how this school has changed for the better in \ncountless ways. Without the commitment of purpose shown by Dr. Cleary and many of his staff, the benefits \nwe have enjoyed over the years would have been nothing more than an intellectual exercise. President Cleary \nis definitely one of those men who know about commitment. He had a dream about what this institution could \nbecome": null, " and without his constant perseverance, this would not be the fine university it is today! E \nH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLM \n(222) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE It goes further to the present dean, Dean Hosek, and the deans of past, some of whom I've known \npersonally. And they all had their dreams of what might be. And some of those dreams have come true and \nsome will come true in the not-too-distant future. I speak today notably of our soon-to-be constructed School \nof Business Administration and Economics. Do you think it was easy to get this concept, let alone the dollar \namount, through all the committees and budgetary process and legislation? It took commitment to an idea and \niron-willed perseverance for many years. \n\n\nNow to the theme which is very important to me. That is the commitment in oneself and to another \nhuman being. Most people would automatically think of one's spouse, parent or child. But I'm speaking about \na different kind of bonding commitment that transcends marriage and parenthood. In my life I have been very \nfortunate. I met a professor here at CSUN who was an associate dean who believed in me at a time when \nmany did not. He allowed me to take up to 26 units a semester when everyone else advised me not to. I take \nthis opportunity to thank you, Dr. Jim Bennett. You are a man committed to the system of education and to its \nstudents. And then there was a man who actually could see my dream. His name was Charlie Soladay. Together \nwe dreamed of a natural resources company. And that company exists today. He and I went against all the odds. \nBut he believed in me. Unfortunately, his untimely passing at the age of 40 never allowed him to see the dream \ncome to fruition. Now I do not only carry my commitment, but his commitment as well. These special acts of \npurpose are never forgotten. And without the Jim Bennett's and Charlie Soladay's, there would be no point in \ndreaming. \n\n\nNotwithstanding everything I\u2019ve said to this point, all of you will not achieve everything you set out \nto accomplish, but I can guarantee if you don't set goals and standards for yourself early on, you will have little \nchance to achieve even the most rudimentary status in life. \n\n\nForthose of you that have very definitive aspirations, such as VP of Marketing, CFO, VP of Personnel \nor CEO, etc., practice within when you're without. \n\n\nThis means simulate the position you aspire to fill in various situations. \n\n\nYou will be surprised how much it will be like deja-vu when it comes to fruition! You will have \nalready been there and experienced the action before. \n\n\nWe have already done itas children. How many times have we practiced asking parents for something? \nHow many of us have practiced asking someone out for a first date or to a prom? Believe me, it works! You \ncome to realize very quickly that many of the principles that I am referring to have been used by you and your \ncontemporaries already. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting you reinvent the wheel": null, " 1 am suggesting that you expand your horizons and use \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(& Y \n8) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n1UHI First \u0430\u0443\u0443 vinum \n\n\n9 de \n\n\nthese already proven principles that have worked for many, myself included. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf these principles, two of the most difficult, yet extremely effective, to grasp are: \u201cact as if you \nhave no limit to your abilities\".

Knock! \n\n\nI spoke to you earlier or being in the position to hit not a home run in business, but to hit a grand \nslam! As in baseball, there are a great many things that have to happen to get into a \u201cgrand slam\u201d position in \nbusiness. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be in that premier position three times: once in 1984, in December, \n1986 and again in 1993, \n\n\nI was able to put my company in the right place at the right time. In the first instance, I hit on the \nfirst pitch": null, " the second, it was the first inning and the count was 3-and-2. I had to score not one, but four, runs \njust for Great Western Resources to survive. In the third, it was the bottom of the ninth and the count was \n3-and-2. Was I scared? You bet! Was I apprehensive with the situation? You bet! Was I ready? No way! But \nwas I comfortable with the fabulous opportunity? You\u2019re damn right I was! \n\n\nNo one knew how bad we needed these deals except me and my partners (who had respectively \nloaded he bases and already struck out). The other teams had a killer fast ball pitcher and all the great relief \npitchers money could buy. We were clearly out-gunned, but not out-manned. Though I didn\u2019t look like Casey \nat the Bat, I acted like I had been there before. And I swung like the Great Bambino, like the \u201cSultan of Swat\u201d. \nAll three times I even called it. I said, \u2018Right center field, you fools! Right center, upper deck, you infidel \nbastards!\u2019 \n\n\nYou see, I merely acted as if I had no limits to my abilities. And I thought as the bat connected \nwith the ball, this one is for all entrepreneurs that have been crushed out of existence by big business, before \nthey even got started. \n\n\nLittle Great Western Resources taking out great Bow Valley USA was unheralded as one of the \ngreat deals of the \u201880s. And less than 30 days later, my best friend and partner died. Both occurrences changed \nmy life forever. And winning a life/death struggle against the company I founded further changed my life \nforever. The point of this storey is that in four years and four months I went from never really hitting a \nhome run prior to July 1982 when I founded Great Western, to hitting a few home runs and two grand slams. \nI went from running a company of $820 by myself to a very large company of $300 million. And again in \nSeptember 1993, I hit another out of the park with the bases loaded when I beat my own former team that I \npersonally trained. \n\n\nHow much had my experience grown in that time?

The problem is, most \nentrepreneurs sell themselves way short! \n\n\nThe Quantum Leap Advantage seminar is all about growing into a position of experience, even \nthough you're not ready now. I give you the tools and framework and make you comfortable that they really \nwork. The QLA seminar is about being comfortable with the position. It's about being comfortable with the \npotential for real success.

Charlie, \nMark Harrison, and I lived in a lifetime in those six years, sharing relationships that transcended business \nand friendship. Because this relationship affected Charlie's life in the last several years, I believe Charlie \nwouldn't mind that instead of a eulogy, I shall attempt to extol some of his outstanding traits by way of a story \nrelating how I met this man, whom some of us affectionately refer to as \u201c\u0421\u0412\u201d \u2014 Charlie Big! A man not big in \nphysical stature, but a man big in character \u2014 in loyalty \u2014 a man that could always be depended on no matter \nwhat \u2014 steadfast like the Rock of Gibraltar \u2014 truly a man for all seasons! \n\n\nIt seems like yesterday that I met Charlie in Graham, Texas, though it has been almost six years to \nthe day. He and his former college roommate, Mike Baylor, were relatively new partners with Coopers and \nLybrand. Charlie had been sent out of Fort Worth to run an acquisition audit for the company that I ran at the \ntime. I was not only impressed with Charlie's ability during that transaction, but I was more impressed by his \ntremendous sense of morality. It was this morality that set Charlie apart. Kiddingly, we often called it West \nTexas ethic! What's right is right! \n\n\nToo often in life all ofus have taken the easy way out: the least uncomfortable, the more acceptable. \nNot Charlie. Though he might have couched it in a slightly more palatable way, he still did what he felt was \nright. This feeling for his morality never left him. And it's with me today! \n\n\nA short year after our Graham experience, when placed in the uncomfortable position of choosing \nbetween representing me or the company I formerly ran. Charlie decided to represent me. He did this in the \nface of many obstacles. Not the least of which was that they were a large fee-paying client and I had little \nmoney, no company \u2014 only a dream! But in spite of this, Charlie chose to be Dan Pena's accountant and \nultimately share that dream \u2014 and seven months later, Great Western was born. Why would a man allow \u0430 \nfee-paying client to be replaced by the hope of big things to come? Simply, this man of character had felt that \nthe treatment which another human being, me, had received was against his own moral code. \n\n\n3 E \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\u0423\u042b \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlittle more than 18 months later, Charlie left Coopers and Lybrand to be my partner. A partnership \nbetween Mark, Charlie and me that was based on trust and a handshake. For the first five months, I could \nnot pay him. He and his family lived on savings and accumulated vacation pay from Coopers and Lybrand. \nDuring those first months, Charlie lived with my wife, Linda", " our 18 month old son, Danny": null, " me": null, " and our three \nGreat Danes in Palos Verdes, trudging back to Texas a couple times a month to see his family. We used to \njoke about Chewie, our largest male Dane, opening the door to the sports lab where Charlie slept and startling \nCharlie by breathing on him until his eyes opened. \n\n\nWhat kind of man leaves the security of a lifetime job as a partner with one of the largest accounting \nfirms in the world? Doing this with nothing more than a promise and a mutual dream? Only a man with a \nsense of purpose. A man that didn't know the Wall of China can\u2019t be built. A man who truly believed that if \nyou don\u2019t have a dream, you can\u2019t make a dream come true! \n\n\nNow it\u2019s a few months after, the beginning of 1984. Charlie and his family\u2019s lives really start \nto gyrate. The Soladay\u2019s come to California, first living in the Holiday Inn, then in a rented house that was \ndecorated like a brothel. But Charlie persevered, telling Cindy how great it was and trying to sound convincing. \nAt this juncture in our relationship, I discovered one of Charlie\u2019s greatest strengths \u2014 his relationship with \nhis loving wife, Cindy, a very special lady, to say the least. Through it all, Cindy would lend all the support \nCharlie needed. While asking herself how much more hectic can it get? Little did she know! \n\n\nSoon thereafter, Charlie, Mark and I went off to London to take our company, our baby, our \ndream, public. All of us gone for weeks on end. Away from our families. Yet through all this, Cindy, even \nthough she had just arrived from Fort Worth to a place that must have seemed like The Land of Oz, was as \nsupportive as a human being could be. She believed because Charlie believed. And because Cindy believed \nin him, he believed in himself. His desire and belief were infectious. \n\n\nIt sounds funny now because I\u2019m considered the origin of our source of strength, but when I ever \nhad second thoughts about an issue, I would just think about Charlie with all his resolve, and any second \nthoughts I might have would instantly disappear. \n\n\nAnd, Charlie, it will not be any different in the future \u2014 for benchmarks of excellence for a man, a \ntrue friend, and wonderful human being, don\u2019t change. \n\n\nWhile we were in London trying to go public, it was that \u201cbenchmark of excellence\u201d that made out \ntask substantially easier by \u201cCB\u201d. Because the professionals we were dealing with were so awestruck by his \nprofessionalism, his integrity, an extremely difficult task under trying conditions was made possible merely \nby having him as a principal of Great Western. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nht \n\n\n\n\n\nE E \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB \n\n\nul Many things transpired subsequent to our initial public offering \u2014 mostly bad!

Yet, during this time of turbulence, there was not \none word of complaint from Charlie. Just, *Dan, what else can I do? Where can I help? How can we make \n\n\nthis positive? Don't worry Dan, You'll have it when you need it!\u2019 \n\n\nCharlie, Mark and I often joked about what we, as a team, could have accomplished in a rising oil \nmarket. Charlie will never see that. But because of Charlie, Cindy, the children and the company he helped \nstart will get that opportunity. \n\n\nCharlie, not only did you leave your progenies a legacy, you left what Great Western and grown to \ntoday and what it will grow to in the decades to come. Because as much as you were a father to Cassie, Eric \nand Kyle, you were a father to a dream we shared together. \n\n\nCharlie often said that I changed his life, and perhaps that's true. But Charlie changed every person \nhe came in contact with. For each person he met was a better person for having brushed by him in the cosmos \nof time.

This stuff really Works! \n\n\nThere are two ways to inspire people to go out and become successful. The first, used by most so- \ncalled experts on the seminar circuit today, is to fire up your emotions with \u2018feel good' platitudes. These are \nbasically high-priced, rah-rah, pep rallies. And the fire they kindle is quickly extinguished by the cold winds \nof real life and real business. \n\n\nThe second way is to give people real information. I give my listeners ideas, of course, but most of \nall I lay out strategies, concrete steps and specific instructions. I know they work, not only because they made \nme a multimillionaire but because they're making my seminar attendees rich": null, " very rich, today. Right now! \n\n\nI love to read the surprise in their letters when they say, \u2018Golly, Dan, this stuff really works!\u2019 Of \ncourse, doofus, / say to myself. \u2018Did you \u0440\u0430\u0443 for my seminar thinking you'd get stuff that wouldn t work? \n\n\nThe following ten success stories are some of the most recent, as we went to press, of my newly \nconverted \u2018disciples\u2019. Read their stories. You can almost hear their amazement at suddenly becoming incredibly \nsuccessful. They can't wait to get up in the morning and get started making more money. I'm laughing as I \ntype this because I know them all so well, and can hear them saying what you're about to read. \n\n\nI want to turn a growing band of \u201c\u0420\u0430\u043f 5 disciples\u201d into legions of successful entrepreneurs. That \nincludes you. / hope you've read this book. Now hear the excited words of these people already on the playing \nfield. Then get your ass off the bench, get out there and start running your own plays! \n\n\n\"Dan's information is right on target. In the past we had grown incrementally, not dramatically. \nWe used to have 10% annual growth, but we've had 50% growth the first year after Dan's seminar. And the \nfirst six months of this year, the business has already grown 70%. Today, I signed the papers to start two new \ncorporations that are related to what we're already doing.\" \n\n\n\u201cOther seminars might be able to show you how to build your business up to ten to twenty million \ndollars in your lifetime. Nobody \u2014 except Dan \u2014 tells you how to take a business and build it to a $100 million \nor $200 million business or more in five to ten years. The reason is that his approach is completely different. \nIt\u2019s done in Quantum Leaps like Dan teaches.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cLike Dan says, for example, it takes just as much time to do a $20 million deal as it takes to do \na $200,000 deal.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n245) \n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First Luu munon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDan Pe\u00f1a has been responsible for making me so much more money.

I always thought I was a good \nnegotiator, but when I got up against the more sophisticated business people, I let them control the direction. \nDan's information took me to a new level.

I don't have any employees. I work from my home. I make \nmoney doing deals like Dan \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0430 taught me. And my net worth skyrocketed to $20 million in less than three \nyears. On the first deal I worked on, I got an offer of one million dollars. Dan advised me not to do it because the \ndeal was worth much more. So we didn't. Later I got another offer for $18 million.

I get paid $10,000 a day, or $2,500 for a private lesson which takes an hour-an-a-half. I\u2019ve taught at \ntwo US military academies, England, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.

I operated a park in Florida with \n38% vacancy, changed the management and advertising and in less than a year I increased the \nvalue by 35% by increasing the occupancy rate. Expenses pretty much stayed the same so the \nlast 25% of the occupancy is almost completely profit. We can fill these parks. Our methods \nare tested and they work. \n\n\n4. We are building a team to do this and turn it into \u0430 $ million asset, or \nmore. \n\n\n5. The structure of the deal is a holding corp., and LLCs \n\n\n6. Our exit strategy is to buy, build up, get better management, fill up the parks, \nraise rents and then sell (or go public). \n\n\n7.

They hired a \u2018Doofus' NASDAQ approved \nCPA for $20,000 to audit their accounts (and thought the $50,000 paid to a Big Four would be too much, \nbeing hard to explain then how much easier and higher the IPO will go by having one of these.

It is my first acquisition and your help would be most welcome. \n\n\nBest regards, \n\n\n(This is the wrong approach because this guy is just seeking to buy a small chunk of the equity of \na cash-starved company. This is not what I teach. There is little difference between the above proposal and \na proposal to buy 10,000 shares of British Telecom. This is not an acquisition, and the writer has completely \nfailed to grasp the Quantum Leap methodology.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix N \nThe Strategy of Consolidation: \nThe Secret of Exponential Growth \n\n\nGrowing a company from scratch relies on successful internal growth and usually takes many \nyears of hard work. During that time, success is often measured in profit margins of 3%, 5% or even more. \nEntrepreneurs often find themselves spending more time counting modest revenues and wondering whether \nthey can pay the rent next month. Internal growth requires time that could be better spent focusing on \nexternal growth. Remember? Kissing frogs? Seeking opportunities? \n\n\nBuilding groups of enterprises through acquisition however, equals external growth and as \nsuch can be achieved in a relatively short time-frame, maybe three to five years, with staggering financial \nrewards. \n\n\nQuantum Leap practitioners search for, identify, evaluate and target fragmented industries. A \nfragmented industry is one in which several, dozens, even hundreds of companies compete quite independently \nwithin a marketplace, the combined revenues of which have a significant overall value. \n\n\nConsolidation of a fragmented industry is the process whereby some or all of the individual \ncompanies operating within the same market niche are acquired, normally through leveraged buy-outs and \nput together as a new \"group\" of companies. The objective is to generate a combined value in this group, \nand achieve a synergy by which that bottom-line value is substantially greater than the sum of the \nindividual operations. \n\n\nAnd heres the beauty of such a consolidation. The net difference between the new combined \nvalue of the group and the cost of acquiring these companies can amount to a multi-million capital gain. \n\n\nConsider for one moment, the following household names: \n\n\n* The Virgin Group * Unilever \n* Time Warner Aol * Grand Metropolitan \n* Thorn EMI * Exxon Mobil \n* General Motors * Proctor and Gamble \n* American Airlines *TWA \n* The Disney Corporation * Bank of America \n* Chevron Texaco * US Steel \n* Daimler-Benz *IBM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\nYour First 100 Million Appendices \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most significant factor common shared by each of the above companies is that they \nall began as the dreams of determined individuals, who then built their business up into a legend largely \nthrough buying, selling and consolidating companies (e.g. Richard Branson \u2014 Virgin Group). \n\n\nGet the point? Real wealth is created through the repeated acquisition, sale and/or \nfloatation (IPO) of businesses. \n\nThe following are examples of business sectors within which entrepreneurs working \nwith Dan Pe\u00f1a have been active and at various stages of consolidation: \n\n\n* Residential Homes for elderly. \n* Independent Financial Services \n* Public Houses and Off-Licenses \n* Hair Salons \n\n* Physiotherapy \n\n* Craft shows \n\n* Real estate (property) \n\n* Information technology \n\n* Digital video services \n\n* Landscaping \n\n* Mobile home parks \n\n* Publishing companies \n\n* Mental health care \n\n* Security \n\n* Coin operated laundries \n\n* Video stores \n\n* Optometry \n\n* Business information services. \n\n\nIf you sat down with a pen and paper and did some mental scavenging, you could probably \ndouble this list in three minutes. The point is, the consolidation of companies in fragmented industries offers \nlimitless potential for quantum financial growth. So why spend your energies counting pennies when you \ncould be weighing profits by the pound? Think about it! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com \n\n\n\n\n\nwww.biz-tutorial.com": null}
